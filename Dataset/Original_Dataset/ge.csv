*Limited opportunities to move between different GE businesses
*Pay is decent
*Company culture used to be very positive and performance-based
*Renewed focus on lean and operations seems to be paying off
*Strong (though selective) focus on integrity and compliance
*Generally strong in engineering and operations","*GE is currently heavily white male, and senior leadership and HR seem to be pursuing a ""purge"" of white males using several tactics:
 ....*Have established racial and gender quotas for hiring and promotions
 ....*Have regular Problem Solving Reports (PSR's) and Action Plans explicitly intended to reduce the proportion of white male employees in the company
 ....*The standard annual performance review includes a ""9-blocker"" where all employees are ranked against one another; in this 9-blocker, all employees are highlighted in a special color for extra consideration, except for white US males (females highlighted in pink, US non-white highlighted in blue, international highlighted in green)
 ....*Regularly promote ""Affinity Groups"" to celebrate all groups but Caucasians and males
 ....*Have cancelled all mid-career programs and tuition reimbursement
 ....*Have cancelled the pension and generally reduced benefits
 ....*Continue to focus resources on early career development, and hiring non-white-males to replace the ones they are scaring off
 ....*White males are generally not hired or promoted except as a last resort (which still happens often, simply due to the sheer number of qualified white male applicants)
*This creates a fairly toxic culture, where white males feel they are viewed as ""the problem"" and non-white-males feel that they are viewed as ""diversity hires"" (an incredible disservice to all of our amazing, talented, hard-working employees)
*Ironically, the company is largely led by white males at the executive level, and they wholeheartedly support the purge of other white males beneath them (presumably because it is a great PR move for them, and it keeps them safe)
*The company preaches integrity and candor, but everyone knows that they are not allowed to question the company's new focus on discriminating against its own employees based on gender and skin color.
*Not surprisingly, GE currently has a problem with attrition (including with ""diverse"" employees), as many subject matter experts flee the company","We understand the societal issues you are trying to address, but pursuing a race-based and gender-based culture war within GE is doing a lot of damage to the company, and is demoralizing for everyone involved. It would be great if we could drop the recent obsession with skin color and gender, and just focus on doing our best work.

Sexism and racism are always wrong, no matter which direction they are pointed in, no matter how popular they may be at a given time, and no matter what your intentions may be."

Stop having Engineering run (and ruin) everything -- allow Product, SMEs, and UX to do their job. Stop trying to over-design and over-build everything, instead focus on adding immediate business value to IIoT customers quickly in specific use cases (here is where Product, SMEs, and UX -- NOT Engineering -- will help you figure out what you need to build). Leverage existing frameworks instead of (re)building everything in-house. Reorganize using small, cross-functional agile ""Tiger Teams"" with specific deliverables and measures of success. Stop chasing ""whales"" and instead use Product, SME, and UX expertise to discover what market needs then execute to the MVP for smaller and mid-size customers.

That's about all I can think of for pros.","GE in New Orleans claims to have a startup feel despite being a corporate operation, but this couldn't be farther from the truth. Honesty is rare and decisions are motivated by political or individual reasons. Engineers are treated like numbers instead of people. Product work is reassigned often and rarely comes to completion with the same resources it started with, so pride in ones work is virtually impossible to attain. Financial difficulties pushed annual increases off indefinitely. Those selected for layoff and those who are underpaid often have many years of tenure over brand new employees who are kept or compensated better. Loyalty and commitment mean nothing to leadership. Focus on career advancement is non-existent, and there are no roles available for moving up.

There is no better place to work then somewhere you are not only enabled but encouraged to grow. The company is very ethical and makes you proud to be an employee. Ideas are not only encouraged, but often you will get the support to implement them as well. 

Finally, the advancement opportunities are endless. If you have drive and flexibility, you can easily find a role which suits your career interests. Additionally, the company is very flexible about things like flex time, work from home, or other opportunities if you work it out with your manager.","Typically the job is higher stress then you might find elsewhere as the motto of GE is personal responsibility. You are always challenged to grow, which can lead to long hours and stress at times. the pay is not as competitive as some other companies for the same job, but this is offset by the growth and advancement opportunities.

Many locations have poor buildings (very old) and are not a great environment to work in. Some are moldy, have shoddy bathrooms, or are generally gross. Perks are low (free coffee is about it generally), but there are things like on site fitness center and dry cleaning to offset some of the facilities issues.","GE needs to come more into the technology age.

Many of the politics and horrible things of working for other negatives of working at less respected companies are just not there at GE. Specifically, GE is the most results focused place I've ever worked. Its a place where what you are doing and going to do are far more important than what you say you can do and what you did last month. Its a place driven by the next big idea, not sitting around talking about the last great idea. There is one simple thing about GE that separates it from the other companies i've worked for... at GE, there is no tolerance to spend so long patting yourself on the back... its all about figuring out the best way to win in the marketplace.","Its certainly not the perfect place to work. Often, GE is too focused on coming up with the next great widget - and not the customers or consumers that actually use the products. I would say they are just good at marketing, not great... but certainly getting better. Also, its a pretty ""thin"" place to work... as in each person has a great deal of responsibility...this is good because you can do a lot in your job, but a negative because if someone leaves, or if someone stinks at their job, it really makes a big difference to everyone else in the organization.","1) realize that marketing is not an expense, but an investment

Also there seems to be wasted time and dollars on programs some senior leaders wish to have completed, yet if you take the view of the people using these tools or outcome of programs... the benefits are really there. Senior Leaders need to listen to the bottom rung more often, and more carefully.","Get down to the lower people more often... in private meetings so they can air their real feelings. there are fears of job loss if you don't tow the company line, sometimes the middle managers simply don't have the GE mindset that they should have, and they control the destiny of the lower level types. Senior leadership could find about another 5% productivity, if they did 360 reviews with the lower level types to cut through all the political head bobbling that goes on in reality. I suspect senior leadership does not exactly know the extent to which there is waste within the company. At least have an exit interview with retiring types and super senior executives... so they can capture the honest feedback on ways to improve GE standing, growth, and opportunities for community, customers, and employees, while helping the company."

Lower level managers are given way too much power and take advantage of it without being properly training in people and leadership skills. HR needs more transparency and more support for employees.

Having at least 3 years successful work experience at GE makes employees very marketable. GE spends a lot of time and money developing the ""top talent"" (top 20%) and even ""highly valued"" (middle 70%) and a ""least effective performer rating"" isn't a death sentence. GE has great benefits and lots of opportunities to advance--especially if you are the person who takes on the hard jobs and are willing to move around. GE's culture is a meritocracy, but social skills are important. There will always be politics in large organizations. There is still a pension plan--it's overfunded, but it's not so generous that you don't need to contribute to your 401(k). 99% of the people you work with at GE are genuinely good people and most people have pretty good work life balance.","GE tends to run ""lean"" which means that during peak periods or when your team is temporarily short-staffed, you sometimes do have to work long hours. Also, GE tries to be competive on salary, but not the highest payer out there. You don't get to be the last surviving member of the original Dow by paying in the 100th %ile on salary. Many of the best jobs are in unattractive locations.",Hmmm....I think they do a pretty good job. The hiring surges followed by hiring freezes are hard on the recruiters and staffing people.

GE does have nice amenities on site in Schenectady, NY - a nice gym, a quality cafeteria, professional workspaces (most buildings anyway), soccer field, two softball fields, tennis and volleyball courts -- it is a generally a very nice campus that continues to be improved. The Energy business is solid -- if there is one thing the world will continue to need more of, it is energy. GE is positioned well to support these needs and seems willing to support investment in new technologies.","Depending on your role, work-life balance is a challenge. As you rise through the ranks, the demands on your time increase significantly. As someone with a young family, I do get complaints from my wife on the time spent at the office. As a profit driven business, GE tends to change priorities quickly which can cause uncertainty in your role and future. Senior managers tend to treat employees more like tools and less like people.

There is a recent ""technical career path,"" but it has yet to be vetted, and the consensus has always been that management is the only way to make any money. Compensation (salary) is also below average in general compared to other companies. The rating system can cause a great amount of frustration for design engineers as your raises are based on your performance vs your peers. You have the option of working in a challenging environment and being punished by having mediocre raises, or excelling at a boring job.",The rating system we use ignores the fact that some groups would be rated very highly on the whole if they competed across all of GE Energy instead of just across their group. It is a hit to morale to see peers in less challenging groups receive promotions for doing the same job that would get you rated least effective in your more challenging group. It leads to the widely held notion that the way to get ahead is to take a position that offers no challenge so you can easily excel.

GE is also great advocate for flex-work arrangements. Although the hours are often long, and travel is sometimes extensive (depending on your role), it was comforting to know that I could adjust my work location to accomodate my family needs.","As a publically traded company, GE is often forced to respond too quickly to the reactions of Wall Street. In my time at GE I have seen wave after wave of layoffs of some very valuable and experienced people just so that the business could report better numbers for the year. The result is that those remaining face a dramatic increase in workload with no decrease in expectations. Then when the market turns, as it always does, there is not enough staff to support the growth.","In a perfect world, it would be great if GE could set more realistic expectations with Wall Street. Since we know that is impossible in today's economy, it would be recieved well by the employees if GE demonstrated a little more loyalty and support to their employees.

There is a certain ""hive mind"" mentality -- you need to know the current buzz words, and know how to make your accomplishments fit into that vocabulary. There is a bit of a bureaucracy, but frankly it is considerably less than what I have experienced at smaller companies.

HR is apparently unaware of all the studies showing a max of 10-12 direct reports for any manager is most efficient for the organization as a whole, and is not extra overhead (it actually makes the team as a whole more productive).

GE is continuously putting its managers through some form of training- whether it be in basic management skills, quality (Six Sigma/LEAN), Finance, or Innovation. All this training drives a group of leaders and up and coming leaders who all speak a shared language. Risk/Reward opportunities are encouraged early in careers at levels that wouldn't be allowed in other companies. These risk opportunities are successful because, thanks to all of the training, every risk opportunity must have a full and easily executable mitigation plan. And finally, I've get to meet an inept senior manager. While I might not agree with their philosophy or a specific action, they are always well thought out and with positive intent.","The downsides are exceptionally long hours and relatively low pay. The GE risk/reward culture drives the long hours as well as relatively untenured employees having ""bigger jobs"" than they would at other companies. This means that their average pay is lower than those with the same role in other companies, but in those other companies it would have taken them longer to be allowed to perform the same duties.","I would tell the Senior Managers that three pre-meetings for the pre-meeting with the VP is excessive, particularly is an 80 page powerpoint deck is required for each."

GE also is very pro-military which is a huge plus to our Nations Veterans.,Pay at General Electric is subpar compared to others in the surrounding region. We've lost alot of personnel over lack of pay. GE also does not give out any type of bonus compensation. This is another reason we've experienced such a large turnover in the last 12 months. Most other power plants have a bonus program as well as pay more. Another problem GE faces is they have gotten so big and have become so diverse they have actually over-complicated the most simplest of tasks. Too uch micro-managing. This tends to leave one wondering at the end of the day just what exactly did get accomplished.,"Pay more ""per hour"" wages to hourly employees, as well as more annual salaries to salaried staff.

As a finance professional you are the most utilized person in the organization which is great because your work truly gets used in management decisions, but even with the emphasis on finance the group as a whole is not fairly compensated for the amount of hours that is required of the job.

The classes are very useful in your role and great for general knowledge on how businesses are ran. 

The four roles you get on the program can make or break your experience. Personally, the roles I've received were beneficial in my career growth, with manager's that give decent feedback on your performance and help work with you on your career development.","There are several downsides to the program. Top of my list is the sheer amount of hours you devote towards GE. You have your normal role as expected, and you work 40+ hours a week. Like most other entry level career programs, you can expect to work 50+ or 60+ hours a week. In addition to that., you have to take the courses, which have recently become extremely time consuming. About 10+, 20+ hours a week. In the end, you spend every waking hour, breathing and living GE. Essentially the courses you study for as free training. 

Your managers also vary every 6 months, and I will have to say that most I've found were mediocre at best. In my four rotations at GE, I have had one manager I truly thought was exceptional. The others were not, in my opinion and in GE's opinion (given the amount of time they've spent in their current positions) ""promotion-worthy.""

In my 16 months with GE I have not heard and or seen our division President visiting any place or attempting to reach out to us.

Also, opening up the braintrust of a world - literally - of folks is very interesting.","If you want to move up, you need to move to less-than-desirable parts of the country. There can be too much analysis around projects - and someone is always quick to launch an unnecessary six sigma initiative around something.

There's also a huge good old boy network - many people are still in positions that should have been eliminated some time ago.",Be authentic. You reduce workforce on a schedule - all the other efforts to show you 'care' are fake.

Benefits are horrific. Salary is at best average, bonuses like stock options are worthless and can not compete with companies that award real stock not worthless options, and work-life balance is a joke. They offer unlimited vacation as long as you make up your hours taken in prior weeks. GE has moved away from the 40 hour work weeks and expects the labor to make up for the lack of resources created by hiring freezes and layoffs by offering more and more uncompensated time to their employer.","* Purge your executive staff of those just mailing it in.

Your salary surveys lie to you. Now that I've seen a couple other companies from the inside, I can tell you that every company uses the same salary surveys to reach the same conclusion: ""we are paying our employees at slightly above the average for similar companies"".

It's also global, so there are opportunities to work with people around the world and learn from them.","The culture is very cut-throat. GE is trying to be more of a ""we"" culture, but many of the senior leaders got to where they are during a period when ""looking-out-for-me"" was how you did it, so it's a battle. I had peers (including Senior Executives and VPs) who stole my ideas, slides, etc. and used them as if they were their own. This was called ""getting your lunch money stolen,"" so they even had a term for the phenomena. The culture is also insular: training (including company sponsored MBA programs) is done at GE-only facilities; I did attend one training session where outside businesses were discussed, but mostly the topics were GE-centered, so there was a limited opportunity to learn how others do it; best practice sharing was across GE...very little with others; non-GE-run training was discouraged. Also, the downside of being big is that it can take a lot of time to get things done, although they have worked pretty hard to move decisionmaking down closer to the customer.","Keep focusing on making GE a ""we"" company, not a ""me"" company.

There is a lot of effort to ask people to move to Rhode Island or Miami. There was a round of layoff in MI in Nov, 2018 (around 300 people), the only reason given was ""we are pulling out of Detroit"" (Can you believe it - not due to cost pressures, not due to performance but due to location strategy change???).

Overtime is not required on paper but is required for teams to meet production goals—at the end of the day the only thing that truly matters is output numbers. Policies constantly change based on the current site consensus. Gatekeeping tactics are being implemented with the tech level requirements, as one group advances they change the requirements behind them making it harder to advance.

Second, GE knows that it must become a digital company to stay relevant in the future and this transition has been very painful. Instead of bringing in new leaders to make us digital, GE has relied on their legacy managers to just try and to think and behave differently. Needless to say, the company has not changed enough in the right ways.",The shift to becoming a digital company is not like a new product introduction. This is not some short term thing.

It takes the combination of a special person dedicating 80+ hour work weeks and relocating every few years to move up quickly. High stress environment with little reward recognition.

GE Energy will look very good on your resume.","Very political - terms such as ""back-stabbing"" and ""thrown under the bus"" are very commonly used to describe employee relations amongst other GE Energy employees;
Company suffers from many of the common stereotypes associated with large corporations; Salary adjustments (raises) are very small, and only happen every 14 to 24 months. Promotions within the company do not warrant salary increases - increased responsibilities, change in job title (promotion) do not warrant a raise - no comparative analysis is performed.","While suppressing the amount and timing of salary adjustments may be a very cost-effective short-term strategy, the resulting attrition on Highly Valued and Top Talent employees is extremely costly. You will continue to see many employees hired straight out of college leaving for other companies within 4 to 7 years of service unless HR practices are reviewed and revised.
Fortunately, these pracctices are still very beneficial to managers of other OEM's (such as myself) who value the experience of GE employees and specifically target GE Energy professionals as potential new employees."

2. GE transportation offices in Erie, Pa are absolutely filthy. There are insect droppings and diesel soot all over the office area.

3. The offices are old and decrepit. There is a shortage of office space. Interns and senior engineers are crammed into tiny cubicles called efficiencies. Overall it reminds me of a Bangladeshi garment factory rather than a modern American Corporation

4. I don't understand how OSHA let's them get away with it.

5. Absolutely no empathy towards employees. I know an injured worker who was recovering after surgery with an injured hand and they would not give him work from home or provide flex time. He had to drive 20 miles to work in the Pennsylvania winter using one hand.

6. He was put on a PIP (performance improvement plan) which was simply unachievable and then fired with no severance.

7. Technologically they are way behind their competitors.

8. Absolutely unethical company. The government agencies protect them for the business they bring in.

9. Company future looks bleak. Just look at their stock price performance compared to their peers such as Caterpillar.

10. You can get a better package overall at Caterpillar with half the stress.",Pointless. They are a product of the culture.

GE is still operating with a management structure that was put in place in the 60's and hasn't really evolved since. Their management is essentially driving the company into the ground and as such, it cannot attract, hire, or retain high performing people to help the company be successful into the 21st century.

The company geniunely invests in development of its employees globally. There are a multitude of career opportunities and there is real interest in finding the next role for you based on your skills, performance, development needs and one can easily move across functions - operations, finance, sales, marketing etc.","Great place to start your career or move to early on in your career. The company places a lot of value on GE experience. You lose out to people who have graduated from one of GE's famous programs - FMP, IMLP, TLP, Audit Staff etc. There is too much focus on internal stuff and not enough on external customer oriented impact. Not great for work - life balance especially if you are on the management track. While the career development process is fair I found that relationships are important but then they are important everywhere ! You have go with the company speak - any deviation from company speak is viewed upon as negative instead of positive feedback. Great place to be in your 20's and if you are in your late 30's make sure that the position is visible and offers you an executive band track (EB in GE speak).

There's a certain credibility that comes from working for the company - in large part, because employers can be reasonably sure of your capabilities. For example, if you were in one of the 'program' jobs, such as IMLP or FMP, there's a cadre of people who have completed the same program that gives a benchmark for your performance. It's like attending an Ivy League school vs. State U. ... Ivy League is known everywhere, but State U. is less well-known except in the geographic region. If you want to see the world, Join GE. 
The old adage about moving around has really been replaced; there's more emphasis on learning & mastering the job now, instead of learning every job in the company by relocation/reassigning you every 12-18 months. That's a huge improvement.","Given the flat organization structure, you can be a the same level for many years. You'll get pay increases, but not necessarily a title change.

You're expected to stay in a role for 18-24 months, and that is rigorously enforced. Even if you're the best candidate for an opening, if you haven't hit that milestone, you can forget about changing jobs. (Caveat - unless you're considered"" Top Talent"" in the annual Performance Management derby).
Annual reviews are done, and a huge amount of time goes into this - almost bringing other work to a halt. However, your pay increases aren't necessarily annual - for Top Talent, it is 12 months, if you're considered ""Highly Valued"" - the middle 85% or so of employees, it is between 15-20 months. If you're ""Least Effective"" there is no raise.
GE provides great benefits, but the tradeoff is that you will work very, very hard and very long hours. Have a kid, plan to be back on line within days, even if you are taking maternity leave. There's not a lot of empathy about dealing with family matters.

The other thing which tends to add to staff morale issues is how frequently we are pushed to do more with less.

Of course new sales are to be commended, but the work that staff does every day to keep current customer happy and loyal is just as important. The sales cycle can be very long - so repeat revenue from existing customers is also very important. Also, compensate your staff. And when there is a huge disparity between peers, make a salary adjustment to get people's salaries in line. When someone stays with a company for a long time they are often paid less than someone new being hired into the position. What does it say to people who have had loyalty and dedication to a company when a peer leaves the company and comes back 2 years later making much more.

There is an annual program for the performance review process that is basically making you keep your resume up to date, and the emphasis is to use the new ""buzz words"" corporate feels is right for the times - after you take an in house class about them..

If you are willing to put in the work, you can move up in this company; it is a true meritocracy. Also, there are 300k+ people working around the world in businesses ranging from lighting to jet engines. Chances are that if you want to do something, it is being done in GE.","Compensation. If you are truly excellent at what you do, chances are you can get paid more to do it somewhere else. I weigh that against stability and future advancement opportunities. Travel has been cut substantially to contribute to shareholder value. Positions are also being eliminated to simplify the company. 

There is a perception that the company is old, outdated, and slow. People often talk about it like a huge ship: stable, but slow to react to change. This is true, but changing slowly as the company looks to lean processes.","Your employee review system is great. You know who your top contributors are, so pay them accordingly. The attrition rate is particularly high for people out of training programs. They acquire skills and leave the company for more money after a few years.

The company values are right on, and I am glad that compensation is based on values and performance."
GE,4.0,1,,Solid company. Pros and cons just what you'd expect from such a giant company,2015-01-24,Engineer,"Greenville, SC",2,2,2,"Very solid company with well defined culture, values, and practices. GE Power & Water has been a leader in power gen products for years, and the company fights hard to stay there. They are not resting on their accomplishments though, and there are a lot of opportunities for exciting new work. At a company this size your experience will vary from location to location, program to program, manager to manager, but in general most people here are professional, courteous, and enthusiastic about their job. There is a lot of flexibility in schedules and work scope for engineers, and I haven't experienced too much micro-managing of my time.","Not everyone is working hard, and those people can get away with it because of the large nature of the organization. The end result is that others have to pick up the slack. In the worst cases, those not carrying their weight are older ""tenured"" employees who have a lot of influence, but are slowing down progress with their lazy attention to detail and mistakes. I'd assume this can happen at any very large organization, however. 

Another issue is the uncertainty of the pay structure, raises, bonuses, and promotions. There is no clear definition for when or how any of those are setup and decided. Speaking with a few people, there is a general feeling that raises and promotions are at best based on some level of favoritism, and at worst arbitrary. These forms of compensation clearly depend on how well your manager fights for you in closed-door leadership meetings, and not necessarily on performance. So depending on your manager and program, you may get promoted regularly and fairly...or you may work hard and sit in an entry level position for 8 years. But, as said, while the raises may not be well defined, base pay seems to be in line with the industry and the area.","Be more transparent about compensation structure. Do not let a person sit in an entry level position for 7+ years without promoting them or significantly recognizing them. Not only does it discourage that person, seeing it also discourages the rest of us who worry about uncertain raises. In the long run, if people aren't worth promoting after 3-4 years, they should be ""strongly encouraged"" to change job functions or just outright fired."

GE,4.0,0,more than 1 year,Fantastic values and positive experiences,2016-09-16,Engineer,,2,2,1,"after shedding the fin-tech arm, it's hard to argue that GE is not an overall 'force of good' in the big wide world. When you get a chance take 10 mins and google some of the things GE sells. Jet engines nuclear reactors automation software ultrasonic and MRI machines. These are things that unequivocally benefit people. Now google top startups and look at some of the stuff they're doing...it's probably yet another ""ground-breaking"" app that lets you deliver food or schedule grooming for your cat or dog. This feeling outwardly manifests itself in the culture where your coworkers (across all departments- engineering sales marketing) will be passionate about their work and the business. They will generally be proud of contributing to technology that can be universally appreciated and not just for one niche purpose or clique. This isn't exactly easy to find at tech companies these days (trust me?)

You're also likely to get fantastic work life balance, BUT varying from business to business since GE is so large. Managers get legit leadership training and it no doubt costs the company $$$. It is noticeable, and does have a positive effect on the perceived and actual work/life balance when your team is well-managed. The longer you stay the more likely you are to get paid training and covered travel.","the bureaucracy. Hands down. This is a BIG company. There's a saying about the left arm not knowing what the right arm is doing. GE is like an octopus where its every tentacle for itself. they've tried to fix this in recent years by being more ""lean"" but, unfortunately, it's just ingrained in the middle and upper level management to have more process rather than less. This may take decades to fix, if ever. you WILL be forced to engage in the latest and greatest organizational fad like 'Scrum' (previously Six Sigma. maybe soon to be Microservices) even if it makes absolutely no sense for the project at hand OR it is proving to be overly time consuming and ineffective. Not all sub businesses are created equal at GE and some are just way worse than others at staying ahead of the curve and not getting bogged down in endless processes. This may not be the best place for the young and brash - be prepared for moments where you simply cannot be productive because of your environment. But remember the environment does hugely depend on the particular sub businesses, like Energy, Aviation and Healthcare. Some are far better than others at being efficient.","Keep metrics for average time spent on processes (including, but not limited to, team processes like Agile, workplace training, company-wide and team meetings, yearly HR requirements and performance reviews, marketing and engineering presentations) and aim, year over year, to drive these times lower and justify their contributions to productivity when this is not possible. Reward teams for delivering promising, tangible results and not just shoddy prototypes, documentations and powerpoints. Keep engineers in direct contact with friendly and willing customers; do not silo them. Focus training in the new grad programs (EEDP, FMP) not on presentations and competition but rather on innovation and collaboration."

There is no investment, especially if you started in production at one of their factories. Got a college degree? Doesn't matter to management all while they'll bring in inexperienced and naive into terrible ""leadership programs"" that should be given to CURRENT employees who utilized tuition reimbursement.

It is possible to transfer internally from one division to another and make a major career change while maintaining benefits and years with the company. The company reputation is great for training good people and GE alumni seem to be in demand.,"Changes are made quickly and sometimes without warning. Our business name has changed 3 times in the last 5 years, our CEO has changed 3 times in the last 5 years, and we seem to be constantly going through reorganizations to realign our portfolio for the stockholders. Quarterly profits are the most important metric. There is a culture of fire-fighting mentality and priority is not given to documentation or projects to improve communications and job-specific training. IT and Engineering software tools are often developed in-house on shoestring budgets which is often less reliable than commercial software packages. The company is conservative when it comes to business innovation and cultural change. There is always more to be done than people to accomplish the work. Individuals are often given demanding auxiliary jobs to do on top of their primary focus.","Increase focus on best-practice sharing across businesses and departments. Increase transparency around business and HR changes. If productivity is a true priority, allocate resources to implement real productivity changes. Stop trying to do more with less time and resources - there are already too few people to accomplish all that needs to get done and we face many complex technical challenges. Refocus IT, IM and GRC tools development groups to serve the customer needs and deliver more valuable and usable tools. Hire quality software engineers. Simplify and reduce bureaucracy. Improve morale."
GE,4.0,0,,Uncertain Future,2009-08-01,Edison Engineer In Development,"Louisville, KY",2,-1,0,"GE has a strong reputation for producing engineers capable of managing projects. Most the work involved managing a project to some degree, which is useful experience. For their Edison engineers, they offered a strong training program that included leadership workshops through corporate. Most employees seemed to care about the job they did. That being said, most do the 8-5 routine.","Red tape and uncertainty of what the future will hold about sums up the cons. Given that GE is a large company, it can be very challenging to get things done in a timely because of all the paperwork and approvals required to make a change to anything. I worked at GE Consumer and Industrial and at the time corporate announced C&I would be up for sale. When corporate couldn't get a good offer for the business, they decided to spin it off. After I left, I believe they decided to keep the company until the economy turned so they could sell it for me. Rumors of a sale of C&I have been around for years and won't be be gone until a sale does happen. 

It seemed like much of the engineering work was being outsourced to India. Almost all of the CAD work is done in India. They also have a program that brings engineers to India for rotations. I certainly got the feeling that company was in the process of handing over much of the engineering work to India. Since there are alot of engineers in India willing to work for a lot less than an American engineer I would expect this trend to continue",Management within the C&I business was fine. Most of the issues are a result of the actions by corporate. Management seems to care and is approachable.

The compensation is good.
Also, GE is all about delivering - the processes are incredible here. If the company wants to roll something out, stay out of the way! The downside, though, is that there is a lot of process and a tremendous amount of bureaucracy, despite the strong push from the highest levels for simplification. Overall, though, if you are looking for one company to stay at for 20+ years and build your career, GE is a great option and you will never be bored.","GE is so focused on the short term (meeting quarterly targets) that long term planning just doesn't happen in most of the business units. It's surprising. There are many extremely smart people here but strategy seems to be done only at the highest levels - everyone else is very focused on process and short term goals. There isn't a lot of entrepreneurial thinking here - people generally wait to be told what to do - and then they'll do it exceptionally well - but they don't come up with the ideas.
Also, the perks are great but the benefits are terrible - they are massively shifting costs to the employees to reduce the overall costs to GE.",

Bonuses for the management are based on them achieving goals sent down from on high. The corporate philosophy places almost all their emphasis on meeting the quarterly financial projections (""numbers""). Goals are often unrealistic so when they are not met, then those doing the actual work in the group must be rated low (""C""). As a result, many engineers do not get pay increases but of course the managers still do and get their bonuses. The Six Sigma quality program was used to take cost out of the business instead of increase work quality. When the economy is bad the management uses it as an excuse to freeze pay and make layoffs instead of figuring out ways to sell more. Etc...",

GE,2.0,1,less than 1 year,"Disorganized Chaos, lack of structure",2017-07-06,Lead Accountant,"Cincinnati, OH",-1,1,1,"New office amenities? Location? Ability to network and a sense that once you're part of the GE family, there will always be opportunity for you here, as long as you can tolerate all of the below.","Lack of structure, guidance, and training. You are expected to be a mind reader and ""on-call"" at all times. They don't tell you during the interview that required OT involves weekends *and* holidays. In over 15 years in accounting and finance, this is the first organization that has required me to work on all major holidays. Work/life balance means we will allow you to recoup your time later, but family and friends are rarely able to wait for a week or two until you can recoup your time to take off and celebrate with them. Almost everyone in the Global Ops Center in downtown Cincinnati is new. This means that very few people really have a solid framework of information about the organization in order to make informed decisions or to inform others in their decisions. I quickly learned to not take other people at their word as most are quick to give the impression that their opinion is correct without considering that the siloed nature of information within this organization makes it nearly impossible for any one person to fundamentally know anything about which they speak if it isn't in reference to their microscopically specific responsibilities. The workspace is touted as a collaborative environment, and yet it does not lend itself well to collaboration among team members without finding a meeting space. Alternatively, there is not privacy or quiet space for thinking unless you grab a phone room. Perhaps workspaces within each group would allow for more active huddling. Functions within the same business are spread out over several different floors and spaces, where having everyone sit together in the same space would make more logical sense from a collaboration standpoint. Departments and functions feel very disjointed. ""Change is the only constant"" is a favorite phrase around the office, but the momentum of change that is occurring doesn't allow for people to adapt and become experts at anything before moving on to the next shiny system or tool meant to ""streamline"" processes...that no one has even had an opportunity to establish in the first place. ""Not your grandpa's GE"" is also another favorite phrase. While I admire progress and innovation, perhaps taking some notes from Grandpa's GE with regards to structure, guidelines and foundational organizational processes would have been beneficial instead of sending Grandpa to the nursing home and essentially writing him off. Bigger is not always better. They lure applicants in with attractive salaries only for them to find out that 60+ work weeks are the norm and the salary isn't that lucrative at all, once you do the math. Benefits are industry norm - nothing to write home about. Employees must pay for their own parking (GE discount).","There is no glory is making your people sacrifice their personal lives to come into the office on holidays and weekends. In fact, it's shameful. Stop drinking the coolaid and realize that *you* have the power to set boundaries and guidelines that will improve the morale of your teams and ultimately the center as a whole. Until then, you will have difficulty retaining seasoned employees who have been elsewhere and know that this isn't ""just how it is"". Also, be up front with people when you interview them and let them know your work expectations. The general ""are you OK with overtime"" seems a bit misleading as anyone who has worked in accounting/finance knows that OT is fairly standard at period/quarter close and will answer yes. Instead, ask ""Are you OK working weekends and holidays when they occur during period or quarter close?"" If my interviewers and recruiters had been that forthright with the working expectations at the Global Ops Center, I never would have left my former employer that truly offered work/life balance and excellent benefits."

GE,3.0,1,more than 5 years,"""I'm really happy sitting in a cubicle all day"" said No one ever",2016-02-04,Senior Finance Analyst,"Fairfield, CT",2,-1,2,"Benefits are ok, pay is great (at least at Corporate HQ where I work) I get 4 weeks vacation per year, 50% 401k match up to 8% of salary, health insurance is mediocre at best, however I am one of the lucky ones and I was grandfathered into the defined benefit pension plan. 

Pay is typically above market..I will even dare to say that most people I work with are grossly overpaid. Most jobs here are low stress in the sense that you can royally screw up and suffer absolutely zero consequences whatsoever. Almost impossible to get fired from this place. There is a guy here that regularly takes naps, watches movies at his desk, takes 2 hour lunchbreaks and he got promoted and now makes $130k per year.

There really is a lot of opportunity here, but like many other places networking is key!

Sometimes when I tell people I work at GE they automatically think I'm smart.","Working here feels like Groundhog day (the Bill Murray movie)..not necessarily a bad thing, just not good either. Each day is the same as the last. A very mediocre existence. 

Now I'm no doctor, but sitting in a cubicle 10+ hours a day probably isn't good for your physical health or mental well being..but this problem is not exclusive to GE. Working here results in such a dormant lifestyle--my physical movement on the job is limited to walking to the mens room to drain the snake. This lack of physical mobility explains why some of my coworkers are the approximate size of a water-buffalo.

What is with people taking themselves so seriously here? I work at Corporate HQ and everyone seems so pissed off all the time! This guy sitting next to me thinks he is the cats pajamas.","I have ridden the elevator up with Jeff Immelt several times. He doesn't look so good lately...I would feel bad for him if he didn't make 400 times my salary.

Who am I to give advice? But if you insist here it is:

Sleep more, take more walks, eat healthier, laugh more, be grateful, do good things and expect nothing in return"

GE,2.0,0,more than 3 years,Very difficult place to work,2016-05-13,Project Manager,"Melbourne, FL",-1,1,1,"There are many hard-working people on the teams. There is ample opportunity to travel to some interesting locations in many positions, since they are truly an international business. Because the work load it is often so challenging, it gives an individual opportunities for personal growth, so long as one can keep it together mentally without feeling defeated.","There are many disconnects between employees and management, as well as between groups/ departments. 

As an engineering project manager, we were often placed in a failure situation without any real opportunity to succeed. For example, business reps and project managers would aggressively court customers (they are incentivized by bonuses), promising highly unrealistic delivery dates and prices, and once a deal is signed they would simply throw it over the fence for engineering to ""figure it out"". Many projects start in this way, far over budget and behind schedule from the start. It is almost as if projects are planned to fail from the start, but just by a little bit. In this manner, they are able to squeeze every ounce of energy and motivation from the teams, knowing that if the team fails to mitigate the problems sufficiently that they will be held accountable and fired. Along these lines, the customer is often delivered a 90% mature product, with known flaws, and then later pressured by the commercial reps and legal teams into signing maintenance contracts or additional services to fix these problems that are usually well known by GE

Regarding management and executive leaders, there are some very strong people. However, because the culture is such that firing, lay-offs (where they immediately re-post the position), and disciplinary actions such as the so-called Performance Improvement Plan, are so common many managers are compelled to protect themselves rather than help their subordinates or others. Another issue is new managers being brought in to GE that are so out of touch with the organization, product line, and culture, but they must either blindly discipline or fire people, or risk suffering that fate themselves. I have seen a few very good long term employees (15+ years) get pushed out the door in this way. 

In short, it is a very rough culture to be a part of. In 4 years working at GE Transportation in Melbourne I never felt comfortable at work. I was always concerned about becoming the next scapegoat or taking the fall for something unknown or completely out of my control.","Accept that your employees are your most valuable asset, not hardware. Listen to input from employees at all levels. Understand that the complexity or workload of a project or task does not always correlate to how much profit it makes the company. 

Respect your customers and be honest with them. Do not cut corners for the sake of making more profit. Do not make unrealistic commitments to customers just to get deals signed."

GE,3.0,1,more than 10 years,GE could be so much better,2017-08-19,Anonymous Employee,"Niskayuna, NY",-1,1,-1,"I've worked with various GE business for 25+ years and have had amazing opportunities, successes, and career highlights. I've also been incredibly lucky. 

Overall GE has great people. There really are no slackers, although you will of course come across sociopaths here and there, especially those on the fast track. Try to avoid them. Enjoyment of one's work at GE (or anywhere) can very much depend on the local team dynamic and the skill of the local leader to nurture and energize the team.

Vacation policies have improved, with Senior Professional Band and above now on permissive leave programs where one is simply allowed (with manager approval) to take the time off they need. Note that this works well when the employee is comfortable taking time off and the manager agrees with the amount of time off that the employee wants, but I fear that many younger employees may be afraid to take time off if they think it might make them look less dedicated than their peers. If you have any concerns, my suggestion is to find a mentor to coach you in this. Folks that have been around a while are well-calibrated to how much time off is reasonable.","Surviving a career at GE involves dodging a lot of bullets. While this has become somewhat normal in corporate America, GE was among the first to perfect the art of shedding large masses of people. GE makes proud claims of being a meritocracy, but most job loss events are unrelated to performance. If you are in a business that is doing well, you MIGHT be okay but even then there are too-frequent seismic shifts. Several times in my career I created amazing teams with clear purpose, uptake, and customer impact, but constant change always seemed to disrupt forward momentum short of the potential. Of all the people I've worked with, I would say that ~80% were pushed out for one reason or another. Very few make it to natural retirement. GE still CAN be a good place to spend a few years, but is probably best viewed as a launch pad. Finally, while salaries are fine, GE's healthcare benefits are pretty bad, and retirement healthcare benefits are simply not affordable (but most won't retire from GE anyway).

Note that as of this review (August 2017) GE is in the midst of significant turmoil due to: (1) financial under-performance; (2) activist investor pressure; and (3) change in CEO. It may take a couple of years for the new CEO to get things back on track, and I suspect the process will involve substantial change.","GE has always had a bit of an arrogance about its management leadership. I believe this is a blind spot. Also, there is way too much in-fighting and internal politics, to such an extent that important decisions are made parochially and often not in the best interests of the company."

GE,2.0,1,,"World's most highly regarded company, loathed by its employees",2008-06-17,Engineer,"Salem, OR",-1,-1,0,"Competitive Hiring Salary

Employee Driven Annual Review Process, called EMS internally. Basically each employee is required to do an internal resume of their qualifications, experience, accomplishments for the year, and your perceived strengths and weaknesses. Then the EMS is reviewed by your manager and your manager's manager. Your manager then does a counter-point to your listed accomplishments (or if you're well aware of your strengths and faults your manager will just agree with you), then you sit down privately with your manager to discuss views. It really give the employee a chance to trumpet themselves to management, but it is really tough when you're fairly humble.

Regular raises, about every 18 month for most employees, every 12 months for the ""Top Talent"" in the company.

Great Benefits, the usual health, dental, vision, 401k, and vacation, plus discount programs for company products (what does GE not make, honestly) and partners.

Vast internal job opportunities, with so many divisions and locations in GE, there is a lot of potential places to go within the company.

Ambitious growth of the company, that so far has been sustained for a few years now. Sustained double-digit revenue growth year over year is phenomenal for any company.

Recent addition of CTO position over Engineering. Having an Engineer administrating the technical aspects of the company is the right thing to do. Having an advocate for the technical people in the company is a great thing. Too bad this is a recent development. 

At least in the groups I've worked in, my managers have been very flexible with work hours and time off.

Strong emphasis on Integrity, making sure things are done above-board.

It's nice getting instant, positive recognition from people when you say who you work for.","Re-org of the month club. The upper management of the company can't seem to make up their mind about how the company structure should look. In the time I've worked at GE there has been a re-org on average twice a year. GE is one of the world's oldest companies, and one of the 5 largest, yet for some reason no one seems to agree on how we should look, internally or externally.

""Roof-top consolidation"" and Outsourcing. I'm not sure what the problem is with having lots of small facilities, but management hates it like the plague, so they keep cutting facilities. They seem to either consider people to be disposable, or somehow expect their whole workforce to be so loyal that they'll move anywhere from 50 to 2000 miles to keep their jobs. Or they instead will just remove the facility entirely and move it to where labor is cheap, not seeming to care how long it will take to recoup the investment to move the manufacturing, nor the loss of good-will and respect with their customers and employees.

Lean workforce and getting leaner. Every time I think we're a skeleton crew, they find more flesh to remove. Whether through attrition or layoffs, each time people go, they're not replaced, but somehow we're supposed to get just as much done.

Far more outside managers hired than people promoted within. This is actually double-edged, because sometimes outside people are needed to break the status quo, but we need to be weeding out the incompetence, not bringing in fresh supplies of it.

We at least get regular raises, which is better than some companies, but with the 18 month frequency for most employees, the raises don't keep up with inflation. The only way to get a real pay raise is to change jobs.

Minimal upward mobility. Maybe its just my division, but with so many managers being hired from outside, it leaves no place to go up where I am. I expect I'll have to find a different part of the company to move up to the next rung.","#1. Stop with the re-orgs, just hold where you are and make it work. There is no magic bullet.

#2. The customer should be #1 and your employees #2, right now it seems like we're at the bottom of the list behind everyone else.

#3. Hire from within where possible but PLEASE fatten up the workforce, we can't do our jobs with no man power.

#4 Compensate your employees competitively, or they may all leave you, and all the tribal knowledge and IP along with them."

GE,2.0,0,,"""GE... Imagination at Work?""",2008-12-18,Finance,"Atlanta, GA",0,-1,0,"In working at any of the GE business you will get exposure to brilliant people that are very knowledgeable about that specific industry (and I am only speaking about the “real products” side of the house (Aviation, Energy, Industrial, Transportation, etc)… GE Capital is another story). 

Benefits - Healthcare benefits are great. Even though you make contributions depending on the plan chosen, these are minimal when put into the context of healthcare costs today. They also offer FSAs, 401K matching (50% up to 7% contribution) and discounts at major retailers and service companies.

Career Growth - GE offers a wide array of opportunities. With the right amount of networking and connections you may be able to land the specific role you might be looking for. Depending upon the function you might get more/less management visibility. At the end of the day any GE experience will look great on your resume and have potential employers drooling over your ""great"" business management experience/exposure.

Culture - GE lives and breathes integrity. I work in finance and can honestly say that in 8yrs I never saw an integrity violation. Not to say there were any attempts at it but they were always identified and dealt with.","Culture – The Company is engineering driven. If you are not an engineer you are considered a “backroom function”. You do not have an equal sit at the table when it comes to big decisions unless you are with a group of your own (i.e. Finance with Finance, Sales with Sales, etc…). It’s a very intense environment where nothing really gets accomplished. Informatin systems are just as legacy as the business mentality. In an HQ role you will probably push PowerPoint presentations back and forth for 6 months not really influencing the underlying information (it’s usually the same data with different cuts) but definitely making sure you appear to do so. We used to call this sort of science… “the art of chartology”. The Energy business is very bureocratic, slow, un-innovative and there is a huge disconnect between the HQ ivory tower and what really goes on in the field.

GE promotes the fact that you “own your career”… and you do. If you want to progress within the company ranks it comes down to how well you are able to build and use your network. “What about working hard and delivering?” you may ask. To that I would say “Never mind that! Focus on building your network, developing your delegation skills, having an elevator speech and identifying the right people to hang around… if there is time left crunch some numbers and send some emails” 

Business are reorganized on an annual basis. The main reason usually is to hide nasty losses and performance under the rug of a better performing unit.

Growth/Promotions – 95% of the elements needed for promotion are the standard ones when it comes to big bureaucratic organizations. Some of these elements are making sure you save “face”, be a master chartologist, know the right people (and kiss the right ass) and appearing to be a “doer” when you think you already are just to name a few. Salary increases are not significant (1-3% every 18mths) unless you change jobs and negotiate your pay in a stellar way. 

GE summarizes the qualities of a great leader into what they call the “4 Es”. Energy, Energize, Execution and Edge. In theory they look great but in practice they are a disaster. Most of the managers think that practicing Energy/Energize is intimidating the teams to do what needs to get done. When it comes to having “edge” its very well known that it translates to “being an ass”. Don’t take me wrong, I have seen people practice all of them flawlessly and be excellent leaders… but it’s by no means the norm around here.","Drive more innovation (put your money where your mouth is). Streamline new product introduction processes by listening more to the people down in the ground. Re-evaluate your promotion practices remembering that you are setting the tone for the rest of the organization. Learn to reward your middle management (not necessarily has to be with money…) after all they are the ones doing the work for you. Be honest with your workforce… you won’t appear to be weak at all and will really connect with the masses. 

FOCUS… you can’t do everything all the time. Basics teachings of business school “Resources are limited/scarce. You need to prioritize in order to maximize their usage” (btw… that goes for people as well)"

GE gives out freebies like LED bulbs and t-shirts frequently. You can still get appliance discounts even though appliances was sold off. There is no more employee buying discount on top of the friends and family pricing however. GE also has a great rewards program where you can nominate your hard working co-workers for gifts cards or cash.","HR made some bad decisions recently. They froze all salaries for senior level employees for a minimum of 3 years (could be longer) to implement a bonus program. They did not give you an option to opt out. The biggest issue is the goals to get a bonus are extremely difficult and conflicting. They've also decide ""co-location"" is important. The problem is they didn't co locate people with who they really work closely with everyday. They also put folks from real offices (walls, doors, windows) into cubicles that are loud and distracting. It's a global company, so you are working with people all around the world. You can't hear them on your conference calls with this awful setup. 

There is no such thing as work-life balance. I've seems multiple people moved to new positions and the old positions now is responsible for two full time jobs. I was actually given three.

Supply chain and product management get blamed any time something goes wrong even if it's not their fault. Top management will talk about what great teams we have in meetings of 300+ people when referring to sales, but in the same breath tell them all how bad supply chain is. Because the executive treat the team like this, all the folks working for them do the same. It's never ending and disheartening. The supply team is full of hard workers who make miracles happen everyday, but are rarely recognized for those efforts.","Bring back yearly salary increases. If you want to add a bonus, no problem. Do it on top of normal compensation. Focus on retaining your top talent. Right now you are alienating them and they will leave. Learn to listen. Your team knows what is best and is smart. Do what they ask when it comes to things like office location. Stop making decisions to help one goal metric that completely screws up another.

Despite operating tax free for many years and amassing billions in profits, they shrink the wages of the future employees with a pay scale that lowers the average wage by almost $5/hr. 

It is also very clearly anti workers rights and does everything it can to union bust any organization attempts, so far as to allow certain ""special"" employees extra special rights to walk around the plant during work hours spreading lies about how terrible workers rights are and if you were to organize they will close the plant. 

It is the epitome of self service, in the company itself and the profits they refuse to share or the self serving legacy workers who seek to keep new employees down while they enjoy their cushy gig. A job that can never be replaced for them now, as no one else will pay these people 30/hr to sit around talking.

If you're proactive, have a good manager, and are willing to work, you will find yourself with a lot of control over your career and the ability to shape your day-to-day work. The company also has a lot of fantastic professional development benefits - again, if you're proactive and willing to work, you can really develop the skill set that you want.","The health benefits are outrageously expensive compared to both my and my significant other's previous jobs. Many perks (pension, home office expenses for those who primarily work out of an office, the retirement payout schedule, and more) have been cut over the last year which continues to impact employees well-being. Furthermore, with the company having a very down year on the market, there has been a sharp increase in the number of layoffs in several business units which has fed into a developing culture of fear and mistrust. 

Biggest con that I can think of - last year, GE found a way to literally take a paycheck from American employees at Christmas. The company has a bi-weekly payout schedule for your salary which means twice a year you have a month with three paychecks. GE, in an effort to get in front of changing OT laws, decided to move the last paycheck of the year to the following week. In affect, American employees, who tend to look at the 'third paycheck' month as a bonus of sorts, were left feeling like they were robbed. It still leaves a very sour taste in my mouth.","GE is a great company with a lot of opportunity, but at the moment I would leave in a heartbeat if I found a similar job with a competitor. It's becoming increasingly difficult to to justify working here with the awful health care benefits (20% of my pay goes to health care now), the poor culture, and the feeling of being a cog in the wheel."

GE,2.0,1,,A day in the life of a GE ENERGY Engineer.,2008-11-25,Mechanical Design Engineer,"Greenville, SC",0,1,0,"There are opportunities to gain experience in a vast sea of experiences, ranging from project planning to all aspects of component design, life analysis, FEA, sourcing, manufacturing, fleet issue and customer resolution issues on multiple professional levels. You will not come away from this job with a narrow scope of expertise. 

Also, Energy is broad and deep in scope. From gas, wind and steam turbines to nuclear, coal and diesel generators, the possibilities for different careers are many. 

Security is also a strong appeal. Energy demand is something that may change forms but will never truly disappear. Few industries offer the same long-term job security.","The processes of the company are many. They are often burdensome, blind, and out of touch with reality. However, this is not unlike other companies of this size. Red tape is a nuisance to deal with, but it also can be a strong guide to keep things moving when the way ahead isn't clear. 

HR operates like a black box, perhaps a broken black box, and despite the heaps of fluffy, feel-good gibberish it spits out in your daily email, it's actually pretty clueless as to it's own hypocrisy and functions as a propaganda machine. 

Raises are suppressed through a convoluted system of ratings amongst peers, standing in view of the industry average, time with the company, background, and lastly, performance. It does not pay to perform. A set pool of money is pre-determined and the lower management is burdened with ranking their direct reports against each other to decide who gets 3% vs 4% or 5%. Naturally, it pays to be a favorite like any other system governed by humans, but overall, it's very difficult for them to play favorites due to the way the system is setup. In short, hire in at the highest rate you can negotiate, be prepared for raise cycles ranging from 14-18 months (and sometimes longer) and try to move to another role every 2 years to prevent your salary from losing in the race with inflation. 

It is very difficult to ever actually get anything done due to the massive amount of people that have a say in any major decision. Some parts of the business (MPE) can hold a project up for over 6 months while it's waiting in their queue. Major changes happen very slowly and individual contributors very seldom have any real communication or relationship with their managers.","Attrition will continue to be a huge problem for GE Energy unless the young talent base is nurtured in their skills, rewarded based on effort and performance without ridiculous processes, and given the ability to use their talents to do real work that coincides with real life. Stop leaning on metrics that drive the wrong behavior and are completely out of touch with what is actually good for the customer, the product, and the business. This current culture is killing your business."

GE,3.0,1,,"GE - Some good, some bad; It is very tough to make a generalized review with ""localized"" data.",2008-06-30,Lead Proposal Engineer,"Canton, MA",0,1,0,"The name says it alone - having GE on your resume (I think) gives credence to your career capabilities and career attributes to date. I worked for small companies prior to my time with GE and I feel that the GE name on my resume gives more weight to my credentials than if I only had small company experience on there. GE is internationally recognized and will definitely garner you respect if you have it on your resume.

If you are lucky enough to get into one - the leadership training programs hold some weight on your resume as well. This would also include things such as green belt (six sigma training), various leadership classes, and general GE inclusiveness across their business units while being geographically disperse. So you might get a lot of experience handling multi-national teams (which is great experience in todays world), and you might get the experience of traveling to those locations.

GE paid for 75% of my masters degree, and I was very pleased with the 100% tuition reimbursement program they offer. 

In only working here for a few years, I have seen a number of people move about within GE, across businesses. This is not to say that people didn't get promoted within my own business, but the GE touch across varioius business units seems to be working well - if you want to move somewhere and there is a job opening, the way is pretty much open to you. You can manage your career very actively, and apply to varioius job openings both within, and outside of your division - and there is no heartache if you leave for a different opportunity. After all, it is all GE.","GE is a behemouth. I work for a small division of a larger division, that itself is packaged into an even larger division. It is very tough sometimes to understand this corporate vision, see it and hear it and then apply it to your day to day job. And then you see press releases come out about your company that you were not aware of. It is the nature of a large company that is so fragmented across so many markets - it is a virtue of the company you work for, and good or bad you will see it as an employee.

A lot of GE leadership is fraternal - you have to have been a part of their corporate audit staff, leadership development programs, or have gone to a highly ranked business school. Advancement outisde of those ranks is possible, but much tougher, and the higher you get, the more this will become apparent.

I thought communication throughout the leadership ranks was not that great. There was little to no transparency (even though it was preached) and the workers doing the work were the last to know about very important company developments. This might be attributed to the staff that is working within my group - but I have heard stories about this occuring else where.

GE is all about resources and scarcity. If in 2005, you can do a job with 5 people, by 2010, you will only have 1 person to do the job and they will most likely have 15 other jobs attributed to them by the lack of resources. Employees are expected to effectively manage this seeming impossibility, day in and day out. I think this would wear someone out over an entire career - I personally do not plan on staying here much longer than 5-7 years. Already, I work 9+ hour days and am expected to check my mail on weekends. This might again be a localized occurence for just me and my business, but I think it is a repetitive theme throughout GE. I am all about working better and smarter, but at some point there are just not enough hours in the day to do what is put on your plate.","GE giving a general company earnings report is next to useless for the general public.

Further, as a globally recognizable brand, being at GE allows you the professional flexibility to expand your workscope into one of many industries and across many companies -- after working at GE -- if you so choose. Beyond the name recognition, if you choose to stay in-company, the large conglomeration of businesses under GE Corporate allows you to have many different career opportunites while staying within the same umbrella. This i turn lends itself towards benefits such as being able to literally travel the world and work at various sites, within GE.","First and foremost, GE as a company likes to get the most work out of its employees that it can for the amount they pay you. This means two things: first, it means that you may be required to work incredibly long hours -- including nights and weekends -- to get the job done. It also means that your pay probably isn't going to be competitively comprable to colleagues in other companies. This is the payoff you choose when you enter one of the largest companies in the world. 
Another issue is that GE is at best inconsistent about employee recognition for hardwork and innovation: This is contrary to the stateed culture and purported focus of managers. I have seen numerous instances where managers have blatently overlooked great projects done by colleagues -- in one instance, the CFO of my division neglected a large cost-savings project because the project corrected a problem the CFO had originally created earlier in the year, and the officer didn't want a spotlight on a problem that was his fault.","First, be more inclusive in your decision-making. There are a lot of smart people at GE, including in non-management positions. While it is important to keep decision-making within the relatively higher echelons of the organization, it is also important to have variegated perspectives before going forward on major shifts in policy or structure.
Second, completey revamp your employee recognition systems: they are at best erratic, at worst a tool of leaders' personal leverage. Certain accomplishments require certain recognition, period. Try to create and regularize thresholds of achievement and corresponding compensation for work done. Third, get off the now-antiquated mentality that younger employees are going to work in similar roles for 30 years; yeah, some will, which is largely why GE doesn't recruit from Ivy Leauge schools (they don't want incredibly ambitious free-thinkers, but instead smart, detail-oriented zombies). Get your head out of the past and start offereing incentives that appeal to and keep around creative, motivated workers of the future. Otherwise, you're going to lose out to game-changers like Google down the road."
GE,3.0,1,,"If you want to work for GE, be prepared to work hard.",2009-04-12,Sales Engineer,"Boston, MA",-1,2,0,"GE has a great reputation in the industry and can be a spring board for future career development. Whether you seek to pursue an MBA or accelerate your career through work experience alone, GE is well known throughout most of the world and companies and institutions hold work experience at GE in high regard.","Training and work-life balance are both non-existent at GE. From a training standpoint, there are so many tools that no one really has a handle one. When you start a new job at GE it is completely sink or swim. You must learn the tools or fail. In order to take on this responsibility, a 40 hour work week is unheard of. Every employee I work with answers emails at 8, 9, or 10 pm. Those who try to work 40 hours a week are typically out of the company in less than 2 years.
In addition to the lack of training and work-life balance, employees of GE are typically paid less than their counterparts at major competitors. Because GE has such a strong reputation world-wide, GE Human Resources managers know they can offer less to employees, expect more out of them, and people will still come and work for GE, at least in the short-term.
Because of the lack of training, work-life balance, and adequate pay, the turnover I've seen at GE has been very high. I have seen 2 managers and 3 sales engineers leave in the last 3 years. This is out of an office of a manager and 6 sales engineers.","Real effort should be put into determining the work loads of employees throughout businesses. There are large discrepancies that lead to burn-out of some employees who are expected to carry a work load that could more effectively be assigned to under-utilized employees. From my own experience, I have seen this a lot between the work loads in the Northeast U.S. and other parts of the country. In my particular business, the demands put on employees in the Northeast are so great that burn-out and turnover is very high. However, in other parts of the country, work loads are not as great and turnover is not as high."
GE,3.0,1,,"Good company for resume booster, internships are lacking in true engineering work",2009-06-14,EID Intern,"Greenville, SC",0,1,0,"GE Energy has many opportunities for learning. As a large company, you can work on different products such as wind turbines, gas turbines, generators, steam turbines, etc. Technical experts in all power generation fields are in the company. As an intern, you are in the talent pipeline for one of the development programs like Edison Engineering Development Program (EEDP), Operations Management Leadership Program (OMLP), etc. If hired into one of these programs, you receive training and work experience in an accelerated manner (2 years instead of ~5 years). GE Energy is a stable company.","You get the large, impersonal corporate atmosphere. The interns are hired by Human Resources for one reason: to be a pipeline for the development programs. As a result, managers and work groups are typically ill prepared to provide interns with the training, assistance, and work necessary for a successful engineering internship. You will probably be stuck with the boring work nobody else has the time to do. If you are interested in a direct hire position in this economic situation, forget it. There is no incentive to improve the intern program because most of the interns will not be hired for full-time positions. 

Management that is several pay bands above you calls the shots. For the technical engineer, there is little room for creativity. It is hard to quantify job performance in technical engineering roles as compared with manufacturing roles. GE is resistant to change as seen in some analysis tools used that are decades old. Many engineers are unhappy with their assignments and are overworked. They stick around because they are married and GE provides a stable job. You are expected to work more than 40 hours a week with no overtime pay so that deadlines are met. Pay is average with a small pay increase (covers cost of living adjustment) every year.","Follow your slogan, ""Imagination at work"". Don't be resistant to change. Innovate your products and services with input from all pay bands, or you will be left behind."
GE,2.0,0,,GE has lost it's way,2010-04-13,Marketing Manager,"Stamford, CT",-1,-1,0,The GE Benefits package in it's entirety remains a solid positive for this large conglomerate. Specifically the pension plan plus the 401k including a 3% employer match are very good parallel benefits. Their Health care program is as good but probably no longer better than other large capitalization stocks.,The Board of Directors of GE and it's 400 officers have systematically damaged the Value as measured by market capitalization ($400BB to $200BB over 11 years) and Reputation of this once great company. The reputational damage can be objectively assessed by looking at the dramatic drop in the Barrons annual rating of the Most Admired Companies where GE dropped from a consistent ranking as #1 to their most recent ranking as #78. This fall from grace has occurred with the vast majority of Sr management and Board of Directors held in place. An amazing example of the lack of integrity and responsibility of the BOD and equally appalling lack of accountability of it's officers.,"Results Matter. Start this change with your HR department. HR presently dominates this company in a way no one truly understands and this may be why we are in such a state of array where personal relationships are more powerful than a persons capabilities. HR has eliminated the Candor that historically personified GE's culture. Specifically, HR eliminated the meaningful employee survey that allowed for employee feedback and replaced it with a useless set of guided multiple choice questions which prevent employees from discussing the topics that actually matter. Reinstitute a meaningful survey to give a voice back to our employees.. it may be tough to read by the Sr leadership but it's what's needed to get the hearts and minds of the employees back. Also, HR should henceforth never be allowed to be featured in a glitzy Business Week cover stories to share their view of the world.. as unfortunately their view it is wrong headed and self aggrandizing. 

In conclusion: Results Matter. A new Leader and Team are needed to start achieving bottom up results and to accomplish this, the wholesale dismantling of the HR empire must occur before GE can rise again."
GE,3.0,0,,Interning at GE,2010-04-18,Program Manager,"Schenectady, NY",-1,2,0,GE has a vast amount of resources within the company. I was able to discuss all different types of engineering with many officials. Good programming events.,"When I initially had issues with my relationship with my manager, HR was concerned but didn't follow through. Ended up as a summer where I didn't do much actual work, and just took GE's money, even after tell them that was exactly what my internship had come to.",Supervisor support to interns is key if you want them to come back. Its essential that we arent left to the wayside.
GE,2.0,1,,"Lots of downsides, but probably average for a large bureaucratic corporation",2010-07-12,Senior Engineer,"Schenectady, NY",0,1,0,"Pay raises are consistent, generally low, but consistent. Benefits are average. Health plan was really good but now average due to high-deductible plan. Vacation plan is on par, was above average but reduced to par a few years ago. Pension plan is very good, but I suspect will be brought down to par in the next few years. Actual work time ('casual overtime') is on par, but could vary widely depending on what projects are involved with. Fairly easy to change job positions if want to completely leave current role, but may become more difficult to improve pay or position within existing organization. Job security is generally good. Cooperative with personal time-off type issues.","Poor leadership. I know that GE was known for great leadership, but those days are currently gone. There is a lack of long term vision of where want products to go, what customers want to serve, and how to get there. Long term projects struggle for years with little leadership engagement, and then leaders become surprised when crunch time comes and deadlines are missed. There is a lack of communication between leaders of different organizations, locations, etc. Professional confrontation that is sometimes required to resolve an issue is always pushed down to the engineer level for resolution, leaders are terrified to (professionally) confront another leader for fear of bad labels... in other words, there is a big incentive to keep things swept under the carpet.

Incredible amount of bureaucracy. Simple tasks that used to take an educated decision by a few smart engineers with some involvement of some more senior engineers now require multiple levels of managers, consulting engineers, chief engineers, technical leaders, etc. Chief engineers have a very confrontational tone as well as have difficultly in accepting new ideas but at the same relentlessly push their new ideas even though not completely thought through.

PowerPoint culture. Inordinate amount of time spent in PowerPoint. In theory the idea is that the PowerPoint slides summarize your work in order to communicate progress, risks, etc. Instead, all of the good engineering work that was done has to be force fit into a presentation tool so that the disengaged leadership chain and levels of bureaucracy can try to understand the basic concepts of what is going on. If you are good at PowerPoint you can go far in GE, but if you want to continue to sharpen your engineering skills you will otherwise find that they will become rusty mostly due to this.

Difficult to get through to real customers. If you had previous industry experience, will likely be more comfortable in ability to make decisions, understand what is going on, and push for what you think is right for customers. Otherwise, customer's needs are filtered and passed down through multiple layers, ultimately leading to lowered customer expectations. Additionally, a culture has developed amongst those with less direct industry and customer experience, where they have become leaders that are setting direction for product offerings, design decisions, etc but clearly are missing the mark. This in turn also leads to the previous comment of rusty engineering skills, where the rank-and-file become out of touch with industry standards, customer expectations, etc. Additionally, things such as attending a conference or sitting on an industry standards board are reserved for a select few.

Lack of team mentality. This is something simply have to accept in a 'meritocracy' such as GE. You are constantly conscious of your yearly EMS (yearly personnel review process), where more or less have to create a resume of accomplishments every year. On the surface it makes sense to put down your accomplishments to refresh the minds of those who determine pay raises, but it is clear that once it goes up one or two layers in the chain of command that any great individual or team efforts become less significant in lieu of name recognition.

Hopefully didn't come across as too negative. In general probably on par with other large corporations. However, currently falling behind our competition, leadership is currently on a down-slide, but as in everything in GE this can go in cycles and has the ability to improve if becomes a recognized problem.","- EMS yearly personnel review process has its faults, but I am not surprised by my job security or near term future standing, so please keep it moving forward.
- Continue to be cooperative with personal issues. Although I have rarely missed time, I fully believe and appreciate that GE would be cooperative if an urgent issue arose.
- Become involved with outside customers, become involved with projects, make decisions, challenge leaders of other organizations and businesses. Currently are obviously absent, which is greatly hurting a number of projects.
- Recognize that rank-and-file needs you to be involved to make hard decisions, not just 'engaged' in process. Pushing all of the decision making process down to rank-and-file is leading to easy answers and sub-par products, that is also not going to improve by 'pushing' or 'challenging' the lower levels any further.
- Reconsider the levels of bureaucracy such as business leaders, technical leaders, chief engineers, consulting engineers, principle engineers, etc. This seems to go up and down over the years, one project 'miss' often spurs a bunch of new teams, leaders, and reviewers, but ultimately this makes the project cost more and take longer with little actual reduction in risk.
- Develop a long-term strategy. Projects that try to boil the ocean are bound to fail. Incremental steps that lead through a long-term plan is where our competition is beating us. Leaders need to be held accountable to a long-term strategy, not just S2 (yearly project budgeting) pushed up from bottom. It is clear that the boil-the-ocean projects are a reaction to lack of ability to execute in more than one step."

Some are the foremost experts in their fields and it is great to work with and learn from extremely knowledgeable people. GE is an excellent place for women to work. This may be due to the fact that management is somewhat traditional, but it seems flexible work arrangements are considered and awarded to women more frequently. GE has a very strong volunteer group that does a lot of community service in the Upstate of South Carolina. For example, GE is a primary sponsor of Hands On Greenville and employee participation usually is on the order of several hundred employees. Lastly, Greenville is great location, it is not too large but large enough to bring in diverse performances and cultural events.","The average work week at GE is greater then 40 hours. ""Casual"" overtime is often expected and usually puts people work week between 50 to 60 hours. 
For regular employees GE has an extremely poor compensation plan. Top performers get ~5% raises on ~16 month interval. The majority of employees get 2 to 4% raises on a cycle greater then 16 months.
Flexible Work Arrangements are not a ""true"" option. There is way too much opportunity for losses in productivity due to the informal ""casual"" overtime policy.
Manufacturing engineering and design engineering have a poor relationship, so much so that manufacturing will not share office space with design. This causes a lack of space for the design employees, so often times six people are squeezed into a four cube area. 
Attrition seems to be getting worse and the quality of new employees is not as good as in the past. I believe lack of talent is driven by a desire to rapidly grow so a strategy of quantity over quality was employed. The attrition and lack of talent causes additional problems, employees usually split time trying to train the new people but often see the good ones leave in a year or two, while the ones lacking skill stick around taking a long time getting up to speed.
Over the past couple of years GE has started reducing benefits for regular workers. Two good examples of this are a 20% increase in heath insurance and 33% increase in medical copays.
GE relies very heavily on ""outsourcing"" and feels it is the future of the company, even though the quality of work is often poor.
Human resources are completely incompetent and I am not actually sure what value they bring GE.","Check your egos at the door because the sum of GE is greater then the parts. Work hard to identify talent and do what you need to retain it. Please reconsider your ""unofficial"" position of Flexible Work Arrangements and make them available to all the employees. Do not comprise heads for talent and accept that some things might not get done because of this philosophy. Oh,yea . . . look at outsourcing Human Resources. :)"

Supposedly, it looks good on resume","No matter how much you try, managers are never happy with your work. 
They are very good at finding excuses to rank you low. The good job you do is rarely
acknowledged. You are more discouraged than encouraged. Managers and technical 
leaders are technically weak. Instead of looking at what you are doing right, they are trying
to find excuses to demoralize you and degrade your work. It is not what you bring new to the table, 
not how well you do your job, not how much technically competitive you are, it is how you kiss their 
@ss and how you look like as if you are working. It is very bureaucratic. Career advancement is only for upper level managers and for them to get the promotions. If you are starting fresh with little or no experience, GE is a place to stay away unless you have other offers. It would be a good place to work to learn the tools which are beneficial to engineers and gain some experience and get the hell out. All work is outsourced to contractors. Salary is not competitive and compared to the amount of hours you put in to GE, it does not justify. Family life? what is it? who cares? You have to be willing to dedicate your life to GE. In order to get promoted you have to move around. This company is also all about metrics. If the metrics are met they are good. No one really cares about quality.

Most people are in a role for two years and encouraged to move on. Problem is they don't train the person replacing them so the new guy has to reinvent the wheel. People are just hitting their stride at two years and are getting efficient in what they are doing. Zero turn over from former to present employee causes disturbing ripples down the line. We could be so much more LEAN if we could curb this.

Managers do not know how to do the job of their subordinates.","HR is way overpaid and under-effective. Look at the salaries of our HR people and they are about 90% over the national average. HR wields way too much influence in matters they know absolutely nothing about. That entire organization needs to be torn down and re constructed to be a RESOURCE not managers of a technical engineering company. They have a 360 degree review process but no one uses it. Managers, including HR managers, should be required to have a 360 completed by every one below them, anonymously. 

Diversity is nice but putting people in roles because we have fill a certain percentage point.....it makes zero sense. Put blinders on to where someone is from or what they look like and hire the most qualified people. You'll be amazed at what you get.

Next, stop allowing roles to move on at two-ish years.... At least 3 to 5 years in a role should be required. 

Stop the dotted line manager scenario....not effective. There a lot of ex military in GE.... I don't understand how their military training doesn't spill over as far as leadership goes. Most managers have never held the role of the positions they lead. How can you lead this way? You can't effectively. ""An effective leader knows how to do the job above them and below them."" Look it up.

Do a better job of training sales people. A common saying: ""customers don't know what they are buying and we don't know what we are selling"". We can't do much about inept customers but we can certainly pair sales teams up with subject matter experts to ensure sales know their product."

Minor promotions with little pay increases maybe so, but nothing higher than lead type positions. Even if you get a bachelors degree. Inexperienced supervisors and managers with no production experience, and with integrity issues run the place with incompetence. No integrity, but back stabbing, and dishonesty by management. Supervisors/managers without integrity, or real production experience are useless, and are a waste of payroll. Hire supervisors and managers out of leads/facilitators that have earned bachelors degrees, as they will make a much more positive impact on the business, but also morale.","Change the OMLP to require 3+ years production/warehouse experience, plus Operations/Supply Chain Management degree, not engineering with the exception of industrial engineering. The OMLP graduates rarely truly understand the production environment even after they're finished, and even after years go by are still more of a liability and waste of payroll. Same with supervisors/managers, require production experience. Without hands on production experience(doesn't have to be with the product you make, or with GE), including being a lead, they are nothing short of useless. 

Poor performing supervisors/managers with integrity issues who aren't respected by their subordinates shouldn't be promoted or moved to another equal salaried position, they should be terminated without notice, and no severance. Just like hourly employees who aren't up to par with whats expected. If 9/10 of their subordinates think they're useless, they probably are.

Require at least bi-yearly re-certification of Six Sigma, and require hands on experience in the process they are improving. Too often do they contradict Lean/Six Sigma principals. 

No more hiring recent college grads for management unless they have production experience entry level, and as a lead for 3+ years. Engineering degree is not auto-manager material, and it never will be."

Salary and overall pay relatively low -- need to leave and come back for better compensation, big on talk but small on action. HR is horrible, 'business resources' nothing human about them -- just looking to fill vacancies even if not a good fit and will lie through their teeth or threaten you in not so subtle ways but they're probably stupid enough to think its subtle.","Be a little more humble and hire fewer lifers to get some outside ideas you can respect.

* GE could benefit by holding all managers with direct reports to the highest standard by conducting routine 360 reviews by their employees so GE can monitor and recognize good leaders and properly address poor ratings (before top talent jumps ship).

GE,3.0,1,,Objective view of GE,2008-10-21,Program Manager,,2,2,0,"GE is a global diversified company with variety of career options and allows for lateral movement of people. The company does spend time and money on developing people and provides a platform for the strong and able people to realize their leadership potential. In principle, the core set of GE values is very good when followed in letter and spirit and for a company this large, it makes an excellent attempt to propagate the values downstream within the organization. The culture is fairly fast paced, ever changing and filled with a buzz that really makes you crave some downtime. Overall an excellent organization to work for if you join young, work hard and fair - makes an excellent breeding ground for leaders.","GE is a behemoth and as a result, decision making can lead to an awful lot of meetings, rehashing the same old story time and again and some days seems like reliving everyday the same way - kind of like Groundhog Day. Too many projects, too few people, constant battling for resources all compound some of the frustrations one faces working at a company like this. In many respects, this is not any different from any other company, but the performance measurements one is held against can be pretty tough compared to other industries - so sometimes one is working with a hand tied at the back. Unenlightened junior and middle management can add to frustration levels.",Develop a human touch that actually values people by taking their feedback into consideration. The office arrangements can sometimes be haphazard and very manufacturing like. Increasingly the businesses GE is into involves more and more knowledge workers who are highly qualified - so treat them better and cherish your employees - this will directly translate to better products as a happy employee is an employee who delivers.
GE,3.0,1,,Limited advancement opportunities for Engineers,2009-01-10,Lead Engineer,"Greenville, SC",2,1,0,"Core industry , Opportunity to develop skills (mostly for your personal satisfaction and for your next job, unlikely to help you if you are staying within GE) , Smart and intelligent co-workers","Very risk averse company, Extremely few successful products (FA gas turbines , 1.5 Wind turbine) - 90% of decisions regarding new product development ends up bad (and most of the leaders who made those decisions get promoted) , Career advancement opportunities very few with in engineering - they like you to be the extremely intelligent engineer with all of the right personality traits who is OK being called ""Highly valued"" (translation ~4% raise every 15 months) and has very limited career ambitions (Once you are a Senior engineer , you are at the dead end of your journey) , SItuation very different with in Finance , HR and Sales organizations (the number of ""executive band"" employees in those orgs = 10x the EBs in engineering on a per capita basis) ; insane attitude towards employee travel - ask that everybody be an industry expert, knowledgable about competition , customers blah blah but doesnt want any one tp spend a dime (situation is different if you are a General Manager etc - you can fly once a month to China and Europe for no reason at all and all is well) , Reliance on metrics which hardly mean anything (eg: attrition traget below 6% - all skill levels weighted the same). Bottom line: Try to move towards the commercial / sales side of the company if you want to be compensated and treated (respected)well","Interact regularly with the ""Individual contributor"" (and do not think that the metrics you see represent the accurate picture) , Decrease the importance of HR (not that they do not help anyone, infact they hurt the future of the company) and do not act like this is some Detroit car company running on losses - yes, controlling costs is important but don't go over board and do crazy stuff like ban all travel (expecially for engineers) etc (are you afraid the employee may build some expertise based on interacting with those outside his / her cubicle neighbours?)"

Strong focus on training and personal development.","I can only comment on one specific segment of this company, but can honestly say middle management did not walk the talk of upper management. I actually witnessed our business leader cheat twice at company functions and preach about integrity and accountability the next day!! No joke... it made me sick to my stomach. Others managed with very unfair, underhanded tactics... Of course, they got promoted! Management often made decisions that were costly and doomed from day 1, which the people on the ground recognized immediately but could say nothing. Some employees were assigned major projects and spent months completing the assigned tasks only to have all their work scrapped for another last minute decision. Very poor forecasting and direction. Crazy pay variances- up to $20k differences for the same job. One supervisor made less than the people they hired. Of course, discussing salaries with peers was grounds for dismissal. Review process was unfair and did not motivate. Ratings were handed out on percentage guidelines. Only x% could be rated excellent, x% good, etc. Friends and favorites got the high ratings while others often found random, subjective, unverifiable complaints never mentioned before the review that lowered ratings and raises. When questioned about one review during an outstanding year, my supervisor simply said ""Well, I had to write something negative!"" It was a joke! Good benefits have dwindled to very poor ones. Frequent buy-outs caused instability... I interviewed for my current position three times! There were also frequent layoffs to cut costs... all while we still made money in stressed financial times. Current employees in my old position report being overworked, underappreciated and afraid to say a word for fear of winding up on the next chopping block.",Practice what you preach... Talk to the ground level employees before making decisions you know nothing about... Don't set an arbitrary deadline for a decision or project and rush to a poor result... Reward employees fairly based on facts... Keep reducing benefits and you will not retain your stars employees.

- once you in a middle management - the salary level might not be as good as in other companies;
- managers can be very demanding (I had to work until 11-12PM and the manager was asking me for an update at 11PM while he was at home and I were in the office) and disrespectful of your experience, as if you're a second rated employee just because you didn't go through 2-y training program;
- if you work in on position for over 2 years- that is too long and you're supposed to move on as if you're doing something wrong if you don't; that doesn't mean that you don't have new responsibilities every month.
- difficult to be promoted or transfered to other positions because the priority is given to people who went though 2 year training programs;
- no respect for certain departments (back-end);

- there is always a restructuring going on and the impression is it's often done for fin. reporting reasons, to keep up with financial goals, not to get ahead of them; the stock has been low since 2000 and thousands of employess lost money (you have option to add it to your 401K, thus GE made money on all those people)

- work-life balance - depends on business you work for, corporate office doesn't care about your work balance, for sure. For women, in terms of work-life balance there is nothing different there, really.

- Employee titles are inflated so that everyone is a ""leader"" or ""specialist"" which gives the wrong people an elevated sense of importance

- The common worker and mid-level manager salaries are stifled to support a massive bureaucracy of upper-level management and redundant HR / admin personnel

- Like most large American corporations, there is NO long-term thinking or planning. Every decision is made relative to how it financially benefits the current quarter. If you propose a $1000 expense that will negatively affect the current reporting period but will reap ten times the amount of revenue down the line, they won't do it.

GE,1.0,0,more than 3 years,disappointing,2012-09-23,Engineer,"Greenville, SC",-1,-1,-1,are there any? well ... it was very easy to get an offer ... that is all ...,"1-Managers DO NOT care about their employees. They can take months of vacation time. Go play golf with their other manager friends. Play ""angry birds"" at their desk during work time. BUT if you want to take 1-2 days off they question you. OR they tell you that ""now is not the best time to take 1 day off"" ... unbelievable!!!! 

2- Again, managers DO NOT care about their employees. Whether something has been done properly or not does not matter to them. Whether their employees are happy or not does not matter to them. They take credit off of your every accomplishment as if they have anything to do with it, but when something goes wrong, they will burn you at the stake. They just want to get promoted and have big fat raises to their salaries. 

3- When upper management make mistakes, workers, and engineers pay the price! As an engineer, my job is to build the engine as good as I can. As a manager your job is to find a customer for this engine. IF as a manager you can not find a customer, THEN it is your fault. Please resign your position to someone more competent. But nooooo ... those who are at the bottom of the packing order pay the price of the poor management. 

4-It is a good company if you want to get a job straight out of college with bachelors degree. If you have a masters or phd, DO NOT even bother, your education or experience will not be valued at all ... you will take orders from someone who does not even know the science behind how things work inside the engine just because that person has been in the company more than you do. 

5- There is too much bureaucracy! in order to get one simple task done, you have to fight with numerous people. 

6- If you are planning to come here to work, you'd better be good at kissing a lot of a$$, agreeing with everything that your seniors tell you, or you will not get any raise/promotion any time soon.

7- The company is located in a VERY conservative area, and most of the employees are also very conservative and biased towards those come to the company outside the south (especially north east or the west). 

8 - Check the stock values, since 2008 stock values of GE's competitors went back to their original value. Yet, GE is still half price. Obviously something is not going right. Instead of replacing those who put the company at it's current position, they are laying people off ... sure!!! lay people off ... then waste money and hire clueless new graduates ... train them ... waste money ... then lay them off to cover your mistakes ... :) 

9- benefits? what is that mean? you will get the cheapest health insurance out there ... you will have to work on national holidays ... you will get the worst retirement benefits too ... GE cuts from its employees, so it can offer a sweet retirement to upper management ... i.e. check John Krenicki's retirement deal ... what did he do to deserve such a sweet deal? Did he invent the gas turbine? 

10- The corporation made $14 billion dollar profit last year, but did not pay taxes ... what is the deal? why? I pay my taxes ... 

11-I finally had enough and applied for positions in GE's competitors. Currently I work for a competitor in Jupiter Florida, and get paid $15K more :) I have better health and retirement benefits. I am not sure how many employees have to leave GE for upper management to realize that they have to treat their employees with a little more respect. 

In the end we work for you! you do not own us!","your employees are not disposable, please treat them with respect! how many employees you have to lose to your competitors to realize that?"

A very hostile, competitive environment to work, with lots of wolves in sheeps clothing. Very little actually gets done, except for power-point presentations with lots of fluff. Functions are constantly posturing, trying to prove which one is more important (who has most power).

Most in management positions lack integrity, and there are very few people feeling happy and secure there. Due to insecurity and/or arrogance, most people are constantly trying to ""out-do"" one another, so there is very little real teamwork.

Due to their inability to compete with Cree and Acuity in the LED realm, and with legislation banning traditional incandescent lighting, this company is going to go through massive restructuring over the next few years as it's sales continue to nose-dive, as it relies heavily on the brand, which carries little value in the consumer lighting market.

It is going to be like the sinking Titanic, with people trying to run to the back of the boat to survive....everyone trying to save their own skin and stepping on anyone that gets in the way.","Do the right things for the right reasons, instead of for the political reasons. Many in upper management are incompetent and make bad decisions repeatedly, but remain in important positions because of the politics. 

Instead of firing your 10% when you miss YOUR revenue OP plan, go to the root cause for your lack of sales !! 

Actually listen to your people on the frontline. They know more than you may think, even if they are not part of the ""gentlemen's club""."

But that's not correct.","In the past few years, the culture at GE Appliances in Louisville has changed from one where employees truly believed that if they worked hard and did right by the company, the company would do right by them, to one where we feel like we are being actively being mislead by management. 

New cost cutting measures are launched so often it is hard to keep up with them, and each reduction makes the job a harder by adding a burden or removing a benefit from employees and customers. These changes are always announced with happy talk and pitched as improvements, in the form of easy to read elevator speeches that seem obviously written by a PR company.

Rather than call it what it is - when something is taken from you, it is a reduction in services, quality, benefits, and value. So why can't they just stop sugar coating everything and acting like we are stupid. 

In the past week, GE and Electrolux jointly announced that GE was in talks with Electrolux to purchase our beloved appliance division, lock stock and barrel with Appliance Park Kentucky. Even that announcement was written to dance around the truth, the announcement claimed that nothing was certain and the two companies were only involved in casual discussions, when the opposite is true. 

So now all the cost cutting and happy talk of the past few years makes sense: we've been running on bubble gum and rubber bands to lower expenses so GE Appliances would be worth more. With that spin removed, any fifth grader can see the truth of this situation: what will happens next is that our loyal workers, most with more than a decade of service, will get flushed into an uncertain and dismal future just so that stockholders, who own stock in GE but not in the GE Appliance division, can make a few bucks while all this is going down and GE is continuing to apply ""MADE IN AMERICA"" logos to all the appliances rolling out of Appliance Park, Kentucky. 

This division of GE is the company that Thomas Edison formed in 1890, and Jeff Immelt is selling it to a company from Sweden that makes low quality appliances with bad service records. They want to buy GE Appliances to fix their own problems. But it never works like that, ask yourself where Maytag is after it was purchased by Whirlpool. They still make a few Maytag appliances, but it is a shadow of what it used to be. 

My advice to job seekers: Unless you are coming for a few months for an internship, I think you'd be crazy to come here now. I probably don't need to tell you what happens when two companies are combined into one - but i'll give you a hint: layoffs.","When you look back on your life, I hope you are able to forgive yourself and find peace for what will happen to the Louisville economy after Electrolux buys GE Appliances. This is an American tragedy in the making. And if you are in management and you didn't actively participate in the sale, instead you just stood by, you are equally responsible for failing to lift a finger to prevent harm to good people who trusted you and this company. But I can no longer stomach this, so you'll have to eat this sin without me."

GE Capital, Commercial Finance, former VFS (Vendor Financial Services), etc. Others, not so much. I was fortunate that Jack Welch was CEO for approx. 67% of my career with GE. Throughout this era employees BELIEVED in GE Values, embraced fantastic training tools such as Six Sigma, CAP (Change Acceleration Process), Leadership Training. Customer Satisfaction (referring to internal customers..GE Employees who engaged IT Client Services for support) was top priority. Employees/Teams worked in the office..together..engaged everyday with various teams. I loved getting up in the morning and going to work. Goals and Objectives were established during the first quarter of every year based on solid data. Projects/Tasks made sense. If an employee was a top performer there was no doubt she/he was on a solid, very timely career path. to be continued below.","Then Mr. Welch left. All GE Capital IT employees were transferred to a centralized IT department under GE Corporate for phase one of the OneGE initiative. A centralized IT group serving all GE Verticals. Only a select one or two small GE divisions (small in regards to number of employees, but extremely integral to GE as a whole), Sigal Zarmi, one of the few female CIO's in Corporate America had the vision and foresight and COURAGE to push back. While the rest of GE IT..now Corporate IT..disintegrated quite rapidly with multiple cost cutting initiatives, outsourcing, so many re-orgs and name changes, team changes..impossible to keep count. Morale of the majority of IT personal desperately treaded water but couldn't hold out. It began sinking and continues to sink to this very day. GE Values mean nothing, Spirit letter means nothing. 

Don't take my word for it..survey Corporate IT employees. Give them the following list of GE Core Values that drive Leadership and employees to excel.

*Strong Work Ethic: Valued employees who work hard and work smart
*Dependable/Reliable: Take Accountability for the teams they lead or projects they manage
*Positive Attitude and Embracing Change
*Adaptable and Flexible: Projects don't always go as planned. Adapt, think outside of the box, and motivate your team.
Ask them to rate them in order of importance. Also give them an option to rate ALL of them as EQUALLY IMPORTANT.

Now lets make a charitable David vs Goliath bet. Me v.s. Glassdoor. $5000 donated to the charity of choice. I will wager that over 94% will select the option that All of them are equally important. It does not matter how many employees actually rate them. My wager? Less than 6% will reply back that the values listed are important but are NOT the GE CORE Values that are critical to the growth and success of General Electric

The real GE Values which truly ARE critical when INDIVIDUAL Goals and Objectives are identified in a one one one meeting with a manger. They are the following:
External focus
Show imagination and courage
Drive inclusiveness, 
Have expertise 
Clear thinkers

Most teams are virtual, in silos, have no idea what related teams are doing. The teams that were outsourced work in sweat shop environments. They are treated as lepers, beaten with a stick, not embraced as teammates. In my last months at GE, after engaging HR and the Ombudsperson because my boss was a bully, a former Army vet who treated employees as if they were in the Army at boot camp, not part of a team. Sticking up for the team who STRONGLY advised me NOT to go to HR as it is the kiss of death and told me flat out they would plead the fifth if approached. They all advised me to shut up, collect the paycheck, pay the bills, and be grateful I have a job. I couldn't do that. I dreaded going to work each day. I was depressed..desperately searched for another job at GE and FOUND a perfect fit.
But it was AFTER I went to HR. I was not allowed to move. I was put on a performance plan.
When I was informed by my boss that I was being put on a performance plan (even though I achieved ALL my Goals and Objectives along with additional stretch goals) I explained that I needed a change after working for 4 years on a team that was constantly in flux, no stability, four managers in four years...my manager informed me that I COULD interview for the position, saw no reason why I couldn't move but he wanted to discuss it with HR first. End result, I was NOT allowed to interview..was put on a plan. 

The rest is history. I could literally write a book about Corporate IT. It would be incredibly entertaining. Solidly backup my claims with data. The scandal stories alone would make it a best seller. I decided not too because I am grateful for the fantastic managers I had in my early years. Grateful for the wide skill set I developed in those early years. And my last 4 or 5 years? I was schooled with 500+ examples of how NOT to lead, manage projects, treat people.","For GE Corporate I have none. Every year we were surveyed, every year survey data spelled out (make some serious changes) and nothing ever changed. The advice I would give would endorse (x, y, z) and that goes against Glassdoor Rules."

This might be good in other divisions of GE where there is better culture and work life balance. Executives may take vacations, but don't leave your phone or computer at home as you will be called and asked to work.","Executive management is filled with people who do not know the healthcare business as they have been moved from other business units in GE. GE does not want to pay the salary requirements to draw top talent, or promises big bonuses and stock options which never materialize. Some executives are not honest with senior leadership about business growth opportunities, product development costs and timelines and profitability objectives leading to a culture of missing numbers and layoffs or reorganizations. Ask for the truth, even if it is painful to hear and hire people who know the business at the top. US Healthcare IT has had very high turnover at GM and above level consistently over past five years. Culture is not tolerant of people who don't say what they want to hear, \leaving a weak culture of yes men. Too much time managing internally and not enough on running the business. Ask yourself why one of the top skills required at senior level is how to build and deliver a PowerPoint to senior GE leadership rather than how to run a successful business."

GE,1.0,1,more than 10 years,FROM EXCELLENT AND SUPERB TO DISGUSTING. OVER 27 YEARS WITH COMPANY.,2017-09-25,Financial Service Representative,"East Orange, NJ",-1,1,-1,"In the beginning, pay was best in the country and so were benefits. 98% of the people looked for ways to help move the company forward and prosper. At least there are a few good managers still left in the company. I believe I have the best one now that I have ever had in my career. He understands that life and work should have a perfect balance. I may cause him trouble from time to time but I'm still trying to help the few guys at the bottom that most senior executives never get the real story about. They cant go up the hall to HR because HR has been trained how to respond to every issue.","Disgusting, current employee watched company go from SUPERB AND EXCELLENT TO DISGUSTING. Benefits and pay were excellent in the beginning but now benefits are 10 times worse tham Obama care. And my pay is less than a third of what I made 10 years ago.
98% of all the people used to try to do what they could to help move the company forward and prosper, now it's everyone for themselves except a few warriors spread out across the company still helping the little person at the bottom to understand how the company has learned to be Hollywood actors and let one think they have input and make a difference. Also, if you have any type of role that is hard to replace, don't bother trying to transfer within the company because they will block your transfer and then lie directly to your face that they didn't. But on a lighter note, once you prove they blocked your transfer with solid evidence, they will finally admit responsibility but make clear that the way they responded the first time you asked that they did not lie to you by the wording they used.","Listen, not pretend to listen. Go out face to face and talk to your people. It may cost a little more money to do that but the bottom line will justify the money well spent. You hired great people because that's what's needed in a company to grow. Now utilize those individuals as you intended. I have worked in upper mgmt and at the bottom as a machine operator for the lowest pay, which I might add was more than I make now. I would have had more than 30 years by now and already retired but instead I'm being sold like property. Look at the company's bottom line over 30 years. Jack Welch knew exactly when to bale out because new directives and younger minds started looking for ways to cut expenses without looking at long term repercussions, because they knew that they wouldn't be there when the bottom fell out. In manufacturing, we were a training ground for college graduates. We had six month engineers every 6 months with a project costing millions and then they move on and we're stuck with junk that doesn't work anymore because they are gone and aren't still there fixing the bugs. After a couple of months and a new engineer, we usually just ripped off everything the previous engineer did and scrapped it in the warehouse in boxes. The company's bottom line over the last 30 years speaks for itself. Now the 98% of the people that used to look to try to help move the company forward or the 98% who are trying to figure out how to cut money out of the company."

GE,1.0,0,more than 5 years,GE - Discrimination at Work,2016-10-02,Anonymous Employee,,-1,0,-1,One can generally work for GE and obtain experience that is relevant at other firms. The company also has top training programs.,"The company prides itself on diversity but compensates those of color (particularly African-Americans) considerably less than their Caucasian peers. I saw this firsthand as I (an African-American), on multiple occasions, found that Caucasian peers with the same title were paid significantly more than I was.

In one instance, a former peer (who was Caucasian) disclosed his compensation to me and specifically indicated that I should not mention my knowledge of his salary to our manager as our manager knew him being paid more than me would not be well received. The peer was specifically told by our manager to not tell me what he made but eventually disclosed his salary. The peer and I shared the same title, with me having several years more experience (all with the company) and a graduate degree (the peer did not have one), and his salary was a double digit percentage higher than mine.

Additionally, as I progressed my way to multiple promotions, I was replaced on two separate occasions by employees who took my previous position (with roles and responsibilities unchanged) and given a higher title/compensation package than I was given.

The affinity forums (African-American Forum, Hispanic Forum, etc.) are used by the company to give the appearance of caring for employees of color while paying them materially less. The company has been disgraceful in many of its dealings with employees of color (Marcel Thomas, etc.).

Overall, if you are a person of color, I would strongly recommend only working at GE to obtain the necessary experience to move on to a role at a different company that will compensate you at a level commensurate with your experience.",Be more transparent regarding compensation amongst all levels and titles and guarantee equal pay for women and minorities.

Respectable company with good management. I love GE, I love what we do, and I love what the company stands for. We're not afraid to make bold moves, and despite a heavy burden of bureaucracy, we do big, important, world-changing things. We are transforming factories and machines for the digital era by instrumenting them with sensors, connecting them to a homegrown cloud platform, and helping our partners to build transformative apps to improve their businesses based on analysis of the data ... and if that by itself weren't enough, we make trains, planes, and power plants while were at it. So when I write this review, know that it's with a heavy heart - I always have, and still do LOVE GE, what we do, and what the company stands for, and I will do everything in my power to make sure that GE returns to not only a company that does great things, but also great place to be while getting them done.","Our cash flow on industrial operations was bad last quarter. Lay people off, oust the CEO, set aggressive targets tied to exec bonuses bad. This in itself isn't a con - businesses have cycles, industry waxes and wanes, and along the way there will be hirings and firings, business class and coach, fat raises and thin. We all understand this, and I don't begrudge the company letting people go of people to make ends meet. We all make cutbacks in our lives when times are hard, the government should do it, and corporations -have- to do it. I don't even begrudge the board the executive bonus increases and decreases that are tied to the 2017 and 2018 1B savings targets -- targets that big have to be driven from the top down, hard decisions need to be made, and if the right decisions are made intelligently, they've earned their bonuses. In fact, were I in Jeff Immelt's shoes with an activist investor breathing down my neck demanding my job, I'd make many of the same moves he's making. So why the 1 star review, when I love the company, understand the cuts, and agree that we need to get back to positive cashflow?

The cut the already miserly 'above and beyond' bonus program. While this in itself isn't a big deal, it signals to me that the management layers have given up on morale, engagement, and everything that goes with it. The bang-for-buck of employee activities like affinity groups (which have also had their funding cut), holiday parties, and 'thank-you' bonus programs is unmatched, and to see these things go means that not only have they made cuts with heavy hearts, they've moved to a point where they just don't care about morale among the rank-and-file anymore.

GE pretends to be a meritocracy and claims that you ""own your career"" but the reality is quite different- favoritism is abundant. And because reorganisation is a constant, there is a valid excuse to promote the ""yes"" people.
Work-life balance is non existent- most people work long hours, answer emails over the weekend and at night. In TA you are constantly struggling between endless and useless team meetings, pipelining for roles that may never open, communicating with candidates on roles that were open, marked as urgent and then cancelled or put on hold; attending training on new tools, lean workouts and still be expected to volunteer for additional projects. Not to mention the monthly KPI reviews- when you need to justify why you are not identifying more diverse candidates and not doing more training on Linkedin!","Retention should start in HR- you cannot attract great talent unless you value the talent you already have.

Also there is sometimes too much focus of growing margins/profitability through bottom line growth/cost cutting at the expense of sacrificing top line growth. Their is a need to better understand the law of diminishing returns in the organization in regards to cost cutting measures and more focus needs to be put on customer satisfaction.","The levels of management have grown to fat and seems the solution to many problems is to add more management when the reverse is needed, more resources need to be allocated to getting best in class contributors for marketing and engineering."

Matrix system has some good aspects but it also creates tunnel vision and employees & managers don’t seem to know what goes on outside their matrix. Employees only see what they do and don't realize how their job functions influence other jobs in different departments. GE is extremely top heavy with upper management making it take forever to get something approved because you have to run it by 20 upper managers first.

Benefits are very poor – coming from a smaller company our overall benefits package was better and cost less for both employer and employees.","Trust your management teams. You hired talented upper management and pay them good money to do a job, so let them do it without having to get 15 other regional and global manager’s approval first.

Respect your employees and stop reducing what benefits are offered to employees with higher deductibles and more out of pocket expenses. I realize GE likes to increase their profit margins and pay the CEO & VP higher bonuses but now your greed is taking advantage of the ones who make the GE systems work.

- Multi-layered bureaucracy makes the most simple tasks and exercise in frustration

- Fragmented order process confuses customers; there are so many people involved in a simple job that it feels like there is no central contact
- Everyone is always ""busy"" with endless required paperwork, but nothing seems to really get done. Things move at a snail's pace
- Employees who have worked only at GE for their entire lives are spoiled - they think they're busy but would not survive in a small company where everyone wears multiple hats and performs multiple functions. 
- GE product and service prices are bloated, not because of the quality of their product or services, but to support an overwhelming administrative and management hierarchy that costs billions of dollars to support


Overall, it often feels like GE is surviving on its legendary status and well-known name and logo.

The quality of people is not as good either - there is a heavy compromise, due to abundant availability of Masters candidates - while PhD is a must in the US thereby ensuring greater quality of research output.

There is no support, teamwork, or cooperation. It is standard for emails not to be responded to. When we are the face of GE to the Customer we need support at times, it is not there. The was actually an article on the GE intranet last week called ""Culture Shock"" where it talked about the ""exodus""of people. This too was reinforced by the internal GEOS (GE Opinion Survey) which confirms my comments. The culture in my business unit is subpar, period.

The best part of C&I was intelligent, savvy, talented people in global environment that you felt excited to work with every day. We always had new challenges to tackle so it was never boring. Change was part of the culture and not something to fear - it was something to capitalize on. Excellent processes and tools were available to complete job and function responsibilities. We had fire fighting just as everyone does but there was also time and rewards to taking the time to blow up processes and streamline everyday responsibiities using six sigma. There was good balance between team and individual goals and objectives.

Fantastic support was provided from GE Corporate on management training, online tools, and knowledge sharing. Even with so much change in acquisitions and divestitures, the GE umbrella felt stable and highly respected.

Feedback was part of the culture and performance appraisals were completed on time and were reviewed by top management. Session C data was proactively used to develop people and effectively utilize internal pipelines of talent. Managers and executives were very open to questions and assisting in grooming the next leaders. Opportunities were usually available for those who actively pursued them.","Learning the big GE world is a challenge and occasionally overwhelming to handle everything coming at you. Work/life balance was sometimes nonexistent but always seemed to work out well in the end. Pay was competitive but you must stay on the fast track for promotions to really drive salary up, otherwise the merit increases kept you whole but you never really got ahead with compression happening more than what we would have liked. 

Losing other GE businesses was hard because even though you understand the corporate strategy behind selling off the pieces, the people leaving felt like family.","Understanding the global marketplace with global commitments, remember that GE is a US legacy as truly part of our country's DNA and that history made GE as great as it is. First priority should be US focused growth and development.

Always appreciate your Highly Valued people who are your anchors and will be consistently, efficiently contributing day after day. These folks sometimes get lost in the shuffle of effectively managing your Least Effective individuals and building (and eventually losing) your Top Talent."

-HR is corrupt. HR has way too much control over management. R in HR should be changed to C for ""control"". They are certainly not a resource.

-The head of HR for a large US Corp (relative of mine) once told me that GE (and most big companies) HR's two main goals: 1) Reduce cost. 2) Push the envelop (salary, tough metrics, etc.) with employees just enough without getting sued.

-Nepotism runs rampant ...people are in positions they don't belong in. It's like a cancer that is spreading.

-No use of 360 review system...it exists but not used.
 
-Way too much turnover of positions...people move up before they are ready or laterally into a position they shouldn't be in because they never performed it themselves.
 
-Most managers have never held the same role as their direct reports....how can you lead people if you have not done the job yourself? GE hires many veterans. In the military, a leader must know how to do the job above them and below them. Not at GE. I've seen many ex miltary leave GE, frustrated, after a short while because the style and structure of management is so upside down. 

-Internal evaluation system is abused by HR. Some have described as fuzzy. I would equate it with quicksand. No matter what you do positive only negativity prevails....and it's used as leverage against your salary action or rating (rack and stack). HR requires managers to post two things you must improve upon every year.. Anything can be written by a manager and once it's in the system it is there for perpetuity even if comments are completely wrong and you post a rebuttal with your side of the story. Only the ""negative"" comments carry on into view of future hiring managers....the rebuttal comments by the employee do not. An employee's only recourse is to never acknowledge (checking a box) that you held a discussion with your manager. Checking that box says you agree with whatever they wrote in their assessment. Well, there is the option of hiring outside legal counsel to correct this but that is HIGHLY discouraged...in fact there is an agreement you acknowledge (a check box on a website basically) that says you cannot hire legal counsel for employment disputes...you have to use one of HR's Ombudsmen (an HR manager from some other dept)....they'll basically rule for HR and not for you just about 100% of the time.
As for the fuzzy metrics.....that is a game played by HR and they are masters of bait and switch and slight of hand.

High ideals.,"Ethics and intergrity are wounded by management unwilling to hear forthright and honest alternatives to proposed business strategies. 

Constructive negative feedback loops to management don't exist and the ones that do (ombudsman) are reactionary to protect the company not assess route causes or seek problem resolution. 

Annual preformance reviews, Session 'C's and the 360 assessment are pure popularity contests and less about employee absolute performance, more about who is in favor: the circa bottom 10% are let go irregardless of being a good accountant, engineer or 'imagineer'.

GE sr. management fosters the concept that everyone must possess the abilities for leadership, which is a distorted view. 

The chosen business leaders are less leaders of business: FMPs and other annoited high-flyers breeze through businesses inexperienced and unprepared to manage or make effective long-term positive impact on the underlying operations and when they depart the business is left weaker and the departing manager lauded with usual praises leaving staffers uninspired.","From outside GE the company should hire business managers, for the long-haul, with contributive perspectives that challenge the GE mindset. 

FMP program is great but rely less on it for future leaders and look deep into the business(es) for those empassioned 'golden nugget' staffers that have the potential to be more than what they are doing (this was how J. Welch progressed to CEO after he blew up a plant in Pittsfield Massachusetts. He was forgiven and management saw unrealized potential in him).

Don't let a business leader favored idea or deal be the catalyst for damage or impairment to the long-term franchise. Staffers need mechanisims to constructively challenge leaders and change strategies if at least incrementally."

GE inspires with its vision and its leadership, its willingness to enter difficult markets where there is a real need for critical services. The word integrity has great resonance for me. Jeff Immelt spoke of investment in Green before it became wide spread and fashionable.","I have now left GE's employ for the second time.
GE was unable, for me, to translate its values into actions in my small part of its enormous business. For me integrity means honesty 1st and foremost. It means other things to other people, and I had great difficulty seeing certain behaviours as having integrity without better insights being shared or communicated.
GE is focused on the numbers first and foremost, and are very tactical within short time horizons. As yet they seem to lack the true strategic and visionary DNA needed for it to be a star in the software industry. This has far reaching impacts into a small vulnerable country where our future is always uncertain, and we need a long game to survive. Software customers also need a long game, as they invest heavily and become shackled to their suppliers.
GE recruits highly capable and resilient people, and then disempowers them with US control and command, PR-based communications and messaging, incongruence between word and action, and a lack of effective local leadership, tools and resources. It becomes just about being a survivor in a difficult environment.","Integrity is the number 1 value for GE. However, it can mean very different things based on your cultural filters.
1.the quality of being honest and having strong moral principles.
""a gentleman of complete integrity""
synonyms: honesty, uprightness, probity, rectitude, honour, honourableness, upstandingness, good character, principle(s), ethics, morals, righteousness, morality, nobility, high-mindedness, right-mindedness, noble-mindedness, virtue, decency, fairness, scrupulousness, sincerity, truthfulness, trustworthiness
""I never doubted his integrity""
2. the state of being whole and undivided.
""upholding territorial integrity and national sovereignty""
synonyms: unity, unification, wholeness, coherence, cohesion, undividedness, togetherness, solidarity, coalition
""internal racial unrest threatened the integrity of the federation""

A Global company such as GE needs to convert this word into action words that describe the behaviours that they want, with relevance to the cultures in which it is being applied, instead of using a one size fits all. The action words need to be more graphic, and more direct, otherwise integrity will remain just a nice concept.

GE needs to move from a sales driven culture to a marketing driven culture. A culture where promises are made, enabled and kept.
Sales is able to have integrity when empowered with good products and services, of which everyone is proud, because they created the needs of, or anticipated the needs of the market.

GE needs a sustainable culture which continually looks to the future in all its actions, from top to bottom, everywhere it is represented, rather than rewarding acting for survival of the fittest in the now only."

The title, was just a title and I was doing totally different things. First 3 months there was nothing to do, besides silly random tasks, like deleting dots and commas from old-fashioned data bases. and helping other teams in random tasks, nothing that can be added to the resume. Manager was very incompetent, it English was not so great and sometimes you can have a hard time trying to understand what he is trying to say, there was not structure at all, no introduction to the business they were working on, people were lost in tasks, not ownership of the tasks, working and trying to do reports from wrong databases, because as a shared Service center, they do not have access to the real numbers and they rely in wrong and useless databases, no wonder why they are in that struggling shape. My job was reduced to download databases for hours and hours with a trashy laptop and try to wonder why they were wrong, when the job was supposed to get insights instead of just looking at wrong numbers. Not even the manager had the correct contacts to work on and it was impossible to ""look for someone"" that can ""help us"", it become chasing people in the main who do not care about or are not even aware the share service center. Many days there is nothing to do, bu yes, you have to stay for meaningless meeting in the evening, due to the time zone. They have ""Flexible schedule"" in order not to pay the extra hours. And while I was idle most of the time, there is people with so much workload. Managers are expecting you to stay as much as they do, very laid back mentality. In terms, of technology, GE relies totally in old technology and old databases, when they called themselves as a technology company, not to mention that employee turn over is astonishing, people quitting everyday.

GE,3.0,1,,GE is FAT,2010-06-24,Electrical Engineer,,0,1,0,"- Management: At least in my case it looks like management is sincere about wanting us to grow and they provide good guidance. Very smart and insightful and heavy-weight in terms of industry experience. 
- People in our team have been around forever (15-20+ years) which tells me that they're being taken care of (or just waiting on the pension? :-)
- People in power engineering seem to be of high caliber and are very well rounded with lots of industry experience
- Being part of a company that was founded by Edison and that contributed so much to the world is a good thing. Big name.
- Pension
- Flexibility: working from home is ok","- Cheap: One striking thing I noticed very soon after joining the company is that the culture here promotes being CHEAP. There is a difference between frugal and cheap, GE is Cheap.
- Benefits: No bonuses, no stock options, no employee ESPP. Just your salary.
- Fat: It feels as if there are too many people doing the same thing. During my interview process several months ago, so many people contacted me for the same thing, I thought that was odd but it stops there. However after I joined and a few months in now, I see the same thing. There is a lot of overlap in certain areas, too many chefs cooking the same meal, and not enough communication which is annoying.
- Age: This is big. The majority of folks in our department are in their 40's and 50's. There don't seem to be a balance at all. Older folks have more experience and wisdom and are absolutely great to have around, they are strong pillars, however with age people grow to be more conservative and less of risk takers and not as fresh on creativity which tends to make things slow and shackled. There needs to be a balance in age otherwise we risk losing our edge. 
- IT: IT is really backwards. Network is slow and problematic, software/systems/processes are way too complicated to do anything. Some local networks are a mess. My desk phone is from the early 90's. My computer is old and slow and runs 10,000 services.
- Complexity: Too much crippling bureaucracy.
- Speed: things are VERY slow here. Takes forever to do anything.
- Fragmentation: Teams seem to be fragmented all over the place, in different states, and cities. The lack of physical presence leads to a lack of communication and lack of effectiveness. Being available on chat is not enough. People need to be physically present to connect and establish contact and rapport. You can't build relationships over the phone or chat.
- Communication: I don't feel that team members communicate effectively and enough around.","I think GE grew over the years to be a big fat slow machine. I'm still relatively new in the company and to be honest I'm not too impressed. I thought it's going to be different.

Management should focus on hiring younger people as they bring new energy and a fresh breeze of air to a company that is filled with older folks. They should give out performance related bonuses to encourage performance and give an incentive to do a better job. Also giving out free stocks as bonus, and enable employee stock purchase plan. If you give your employees ownership in your company they will be more effective and careful. There needs to be a lot of focus on IT spending to improve the platform that supports everyone. The better IT is, the more efficient things go around. There needs to be really big spending in IT to get up to par. Finally the Matrix sucks."

- you get to learn things very quickly at GE. 
-management keeps track of your work so if there is an opening you will be considered before others.
-very good internal hiring
- if you negotiate correctly with your manager your salary can be very good. If you have a university education then you will start off with a great salary. If you have just completed high school then there are still many opportunities for you but your salary will suffer a bit but if you work hard and put in some years, your salary will increase to a certain extent.
- looks good on a resume","- management is not helpful at all and blame the employees for everything.
- basically, GE knows that because they are a big company and that everyone wants to work for them since it looks good on your resume, you are easily replaceable.
- Turnover is very high and everyone is working there for the money and not for the people.
- I would advice everyone who works there to always keep copies of your emails because there will be many times that management will blame you for something. If you keep copies and confirmations from people then you have evidence that the job was done.
- people are very childish and it's like going back to high school. Alot of back-biting and passing your work off to someone who works below you.
- bad incentives for employees. There was no TV or employee lounge, the vending machines were bad and employee morale is very low
- no collaboration between managers and employees
- On the first day, you are basically told you what your job is and then its sink or skim. 
- management leaves early all the time. On Fridays you will not find any managers working after 2","- try to collaborate with your employees.
- the culture is very bad and people have very low morale yet this can be easily fixed if management were to acknowledge people and their work.
- try giving more incentives to people or putting in some money in employee programs. 
- the whole structure at GE needs to be changes since it is such a untrustworthy and hostile environment."
GE,2.0,0,,Why working for GE isn't all that great,2010-02-16,,,-1,-1,0,"If you want to move up, there are opportunities to do so.
If you're fresh out of college and thinking of management, there are programs within many business disciplines to get you there.
They have a global footprint, so location will never be a problem.
They are very serious about having a non-hostile work environment.
They are very good to mention who's been promoted, retired, etc.","They mostly pay ""competitively"", which means ""lower than average, but close enough"".
There is no direct correlation between your annual reviews and your raises.
Some people will only work with you if it does not interfere with their own work.
Some business areas are so large nobody knows how they relate. It makes it very difficult to find help outside your area.
Because there are a multitude of ""personal websites"", it's very difficult knowing where to go and how to start a process. You have to ""know somebody"" to get your job done.
You train with your own time and money. Training budgets were reducing every year.
During any ""state of the business"" meeting, the leaders don't seem very excited as a whole. New products are introduced sounding like it's an afterthought. There is so much stuff on the powerpoints you forget what the core message is.
The leaders can't explain their messages in clear, succint tones. Everything is ""GE-speak"".","Make your messages clear and concise - no ""GE-speak"".
If you're excited about your company, then show it.
If a person voluntarily leaves, do you attempt to find out what you as a company could have done better to keep that person?
Using the down economy as an excuse to keep salaries and budgets low, and saying ""you're lucky to have a job"", doesn't really show you value your employees. Ask yourselves what you can be doing better."

It's hard to get real metrics, because as the absolute number of people grows, naturally the number of bad apples grows; as a percentage it's supposedly the same as it ever was, but with larger numbers of poorer quality engineers it just _feels_ like things might be changing for the worse.
* Also with growth means more internal-confidential data leaks (again, because of the raw numbers of people) -- product announcements being ruined, etc. That means the company has to be tighter-lipped internally to avoid leaks, which makes things less open. It's still an amazingly open place, but less so than it was even a couple years ago. The good thing is they recognize it and actively look to improve things because they know how important it is to keep the good culture.","Keep the focus on the user.

GE inspires with its vision and its leadership, its willingness to enter difficult markets where there is a real need for critical services. The word integrity has great resonance for me. Jeff Immelt spoke of investment in Green before it became wide spread and fashionable.","I have now left GE's employ for the second time.
GE was unable, for me, to translate its values into actions in my small part of its enormous business. For me integrity means honesty 1st and foremost. It means other things to other people, and I had great difficulty seeing certain behaviours as having integrity without better insights being shared or communicated.
GE is focused on the numbers first and foremost, and are very tactical within short time horizons. As yet they seem to lack the true strategic and visionary DNA needed for it to be a star in the software industry. This has far reaching impacts into a small vulnerable country where our future is always uncertain, and we need a long game to survive. Software customers also need a long game, as they invest heavily and become shackled to their suppliers.
GE recruits highly capable and resilient people, and then disempowers them with US control and command, PR-based communications and messaging, incongruence between word and action, and a lack of effective local leadership, tools and resources. It becomes just about being a survivor in a difficult environment.","Integrity is the number 1 value for GE. However, it can mean very different things based on your cultural filters.
1.the quality of being honest and having strong moral principles.
""a gentleman of complete integrity""
synonyms: honesty, uprightness, probity, rectitude, honour, honourableness, upstandingness, good character, principle(s), ethics, morals, righteousness, morality, nobility, high-mindedness, right-mindedness, noble-mindedness, virtue, decency, fairness, scrupulousness, sincerity, truthfulness, trustworthiness
""I never doubted his integrity""
2. the state of being whole and undivided.
""upholding territorial integrity and national sovereignty""
synonyms: unity, unification, wholeness, coherence, cohesion, undividedness, togetherness, solidarity, coalition
""internal racial unrest threatened the integrity of the federation""

A Global company such as GE needs to convert this word into action words that describe the behaviours that they want, with relevance to the cultures in which it is being applied, instead of using a one size fits all. The action words need to be more graphic, and more direct, otherwise integrity will remain just a nice concept.

GE needs to move from a sales driven culture to a marketing driven culture. A culture where promises are made, enabled and kept.
Sales is able to have integrity when empowered with good products and services, of which everyone is proud, because they created the needs of, or anticipated the needs of the market.

GE needs a sustainable culture which continually looks to the future in all its actions, from top to bottom, everywhere it is represented, rather than rewarding acting for survival of the fittest in the now only."

Make sure you're working on a site that gives a dam about staff. If you do it’s a great place to work and can have a great career with some very good engineers.","In the 5 years I worked at my site there they never spent a single dollar on my development. All personal development I done was from my own pocket and holiday time. Current staff who stay, have been long term additions to the company with many typically straight from university, some 10-15 years ago. They have become very very arrogant to such an extent that new staff that come in with ideas and improvements from other companies and universities, are seen as a threat and ridiculed in front of peers, specially true for new staff with higher education. 

I worked typically 52 - 74 hrs a week on tasks that are always deadlines and need to be done, with no support from peers. People were leaving (no surprise there) and not being replaced, forcing staff to take up the slack. I guess it’s an ideal situation for higher managers to look good, do the same work with less staff. Just threaten people and crack the whip, sorry it’s not the 1800’s and no one deserves to be treated like that.

You need to be in with the crowd to be noticed, certain people are with the ""in"" crowd, others are spoken to like an idiot. 

Raise staff bullying and your low salary to site HR rep and you are burned at your yearly review. You're highlighted as a trouble maker and told your ""career in GE is over"" and that ""they wouldn't mind seeing you go"". 

Even when you take that on the chin and stay with the company they take disciplinary action against you with some made up evidence to get you out the door, but it's your word against theirs. ""It’s your year to be thrown under the bus"" was the term I was told. When you try to appeal your told inaccurate HR policy and told no grounds to appeal against a rating that you've been given. The same rating that stays with you for your entire time at GE, so no prospect of promotion or moving within the company.... ever.","You have a great company but you need to be less strategic and more feet on the ground. Your low level team leaders, engineering managers are killing moral and you’re losing your talent. They need to be replaced they are bad to the core. The customers are seeing this and company image is dying. When all you have left is leaders who take no responsibility and stab each other in the back, it will be too late.

- Flexible work hours
- Interesting portfolio of products and services","- Constant reorganizations, department name changes, and employee title changes confuse customers and employees alike
- Multi-layered bureaucracy makes the most simple tasks and exercise in frustration
- Most employee titles are fluffed up to the point where everyone thinks they are a ""big shot""
- Fragmented order process confuses customers; there are so many people involved in a simple job that it feels like there is no central contact
- Everyone is always ""busy"" with endless required paperwork, but nothing seems to really get done. Things move at a snail's pace
- Employees who have worked only at GE for their entire lives are spoiled - they think they're busy but would not survive in a small company where everyone wears multiple hats and performs multiple functions. 
- GE product and service prices are bloated, not because of the quality of their product or services, but to support an overwhelming administrative and management hierarchy that costs billions of dollars to support


Overall, it often feels like GE is surviving on its legendary status and well-known name and logo. It is the type of company where the smart people learn what not to do when running a business, then go to a smaller company or start their own to perform things more efficiently and for a better price. They still make decent products, but this company is going to be eclipsed by other companies that are more innovative and less bloated.",
