Meta,5.0,1,less than 1 year,Best employer so far,2021-11-09,Software Engineer,"Seattle, WA",2,2,2,"I’m still a bit new, but I have very good impressions so far. I have 10 years exp at 5+ other companies (although no other tech companies) and this is the best by a good margin. 

First off, everyone is nice here! Yes, folks are ambitious, but there is a shockingly small percentage of jerks here… not sure exactly how they are weeded out, but I’m grateful for it!

Lots of small benefits and well-run systems give the overwhelming feeling that this company just generally has its sh*t together. Shuttles, good food, good internal chat and groups system, not too many meetings or emails (much better than other companies!), great tech stack and automation, etc etc. 

Pretty good transparency and communication with leadership (e.g., weekly CEO/CTO Q&As). They are open to feedback and change when needed, without too much unnecessary reorg-ing and pivoting. Good examples recently are moving to annual performance reviews after years of complaints with 6-month cycle, decoupling Oculus and FB accounts, and killing facial recognition. 

Comp is fantastic, and relatively standardized within levels. Engineers don’t have different titles between levels, we’re all just software engineers. This was weird at first, but is a really cool feature that discourages dumb hierarchies. 

Work life balance is totally reasonable in my experience, but might be different on other teams. 

Mark is great, I don’t really understand why folks dislike him externally.","Some risk with new company direction. The metaverse shift is gutsy. It seems like a reasonable move, but if it doesn’t pan out, Meta might not be the same tech giant in 10-15 years. 

Like any big company, it has its share of internal koolaid/propaganda (but criticism/feedback is still welcomed and discussed openly) 

The (largely overblown) negative media coverage can lead to some family and friends judging you a bit for where you work, if you care about that sort of thing.",

The greatest aspect of working at Facebook is that everyone is very motivated and very smart. The problem with this is that they all expect the very same of you.

Meta,5.0,1,more than 3 years,Career-Changing Opportunity,2022-01-25,Project Manager,"San Francisco, CA",2,2,2,"• Meta is an incredible place to gain experience, work (and network!) with people who are at the top of their fields, and grow your own skill set—IF you invest the effort and time to make it happen. 
• Many employees have the chance to work with people from all over the world, in an environment that encourages different perspectives. 
• I never thought someone like me would belong at a company like this—but I feel welcomed and encouraged, and I'm grateful to have learned so much (personally and professionally) from my coworkers. Never would've believed I'd feel this way while starting remotely during COVID, either!
• Most managers at Meta really want to be managers; folks aren't promoted just because it's the next most logical step in their career. In my experience, this means most managers are supportive, want to see you succeed, and are invested in helping you grow your career, not just in furthering their own agenda.
• Comp & benefits are amazing. WHY DID MY GUIDANCE COUNSELORS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE NOT TELL ME ABOUT RSUs??? That is all. 
• Having Meta on your resumé will open doors in a way that name dropping few other companies would.
• The support Meta provided throughout COVID has been exceptional, with flexibility and leave options that have helped me deal with remote learning, childcare gaps, and more. I've repeatedly told friends how lucky I have been to have joined Meta just before the pandemic.","• There are high expectations. ""Move fast"" isn't just a value — it's a description of how we work. If you like rigid work structures and aligning to predefined goals without questioning or re-assessing them as you progress, you probably won't thrive in the Meta environment. 
• Because of this constant flux, it can be hard to take PTO or maintain a consistently good work/life balance. This honestly depends on your team and manager, as well as how good you are at prioritizing. (Hint: Get comfortable saying no.)
• Constant press leaks continue to threaten the previously ""open by default"" culture, complicating some teams' jobs (as they react to announcements vs. prepare for announcements).","Listen to these reviews, and internal survey results. Keep the culture open."

I have learned from how others process information and look things, their approach to solving problems, how they structure information and the flags they raise. I have been able to see 'in action' different perspective that have brought awareness and growth, personally and professionally. The people I work with, is the number one reason I am still, and will continue to work here. A second important factor is the flexibility and multiple options that employees are given for returning to work post-pandemic. We have the ability to request remote work and relocate. Every employee has the option to tailor their work schedules and adopt to suite their life styles. Fair and competitive compensation and benefits are secondary.","Every workplace has opportunities for growth and while not everything is perfect at Meta, no one has said that we have stopped growing. The constant changes indicate the pains of growth and bring hope that things are being looked at and that feedback from employees is being applied.

It is apparent that there is no management support for this role in any form. The role was created in an attempt to fool regulators and stockholders into thinking that things are changing at facebook. The mission of facebook is to misuse private data and the role is an attempt to distract the public from that fact. I am an h1b, much like most facebook employees, and i am threatened with being booted from the program whenever i attempt to protect customer data from being exposed. If anyone from management is reading this i sincerely believe facebook is the proverbial boulder rolling down a hill with too much momentum to stop the downward slide.

Work is challenging, and you get lots of opportunities to stretch and grow.","COVID has made it almost untenable at Meta. Coverage for leaves falls on existing team with little to no empathy or support. You're expected to just make it work and figure it out. There are no tradeoffs or prioritization with goals. Because nothing drops off the laundry list of priorities, few things actually get accomplished and the cycle repeats year after year. Meta is turning into a corporate behemoth that's too insular to accept and act on feedback from users, employees, etc... When you start to think you know best, and everyone else is just wrong, it's a bad sign (this isn't just a bad press cycle - Meta needs to get better about the negative role it plays in misinformation, harmful content, etc.)","Start listening and stop defending the mistakes.

When you’re not in the mood for gourmet, your destination is Main Street. Here, you’ll find outlets and food trucks that serve burgers, ice cream, Tex-Mex, and barbecue. You could experience the cozy ambiance and nice features when you hang out with colleagues.

Almost Everything is FREE
The company provides incredible employment benefits such as healthcare services (medical and dental), laundry service, salon, bike repair hub, company shuttle, and twenty-one paid days off. It includes generous parental leave, by-popular-demand-to-expand gym, and a bank.

Creative Distraction
If an employee needs time for a creative and fun distraction, the company has a woodworking workshop, and a print shop for them to extract their creative juices.

If you want to join big happy companies, such as working at Facebook, offer it all you have. Get the most effective and efficient executive resume writing service to ensure success in your career. Check our website to view our process.","Open Workspace
Facebook encourages you to be yourself. Ironically, the company designed the office as a no-wall workspace policy, which you may find uncomfortable and lacking privacy.

Buffet-at-Work
The open workspace provides picnic-style tables, where you can sit shoulder-to-shoulder, with limited space, and gives no privacy. You will be rubbing elbows with colleagues… literally!

The Facebook Employee Stereotype
Most people expect Facebook employees to know everything on the site. You may still receive questions and hear complaints from people even outside the workplace.

Executives Who Discriminate
An anonymous former Facebook employee claimed he had his worst working experience in the company. He said higher-ups treats him like trash, gives him minimal guidance, and hands him inappropriate tasks such as sorting the director’s laundry.

The “Holier-Than-Thou” Attitude
One source complains that CEO and Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg and COO, Sheryl Sandberg are both self-righteous. He claims they spend too much time on “extracurricular activities.” The said source also accused the two of copying-off competition; for instance, the poke that resembles the one on Snapchat",

The perks are amazing, free food, free healthcare and the resources you have are the best.","Being a white male with a African American wife.....during my time at Facebook I was called racist, insensitive and bias. It was frustrating to go home and tell my wife instances at Facebook and then get her opinion saying I said or did nothing wrong. Over and over again I was looked at as the enemy when I had no intention of hurting anyone. 

Being a white male at Facebook you are looked at as the problem and reason that is bringing a certain race or ethnicity down. During my bi annual review I was told by my Asian manager to work on toning down ""Your White privilege"" during meetings. Excuse me? If my wife had a manager that asked or accused her of taking advantage of the fact she's black there would be lawsuit. 

I am not a racist, I or my parents, grandparents or great grandparents have never enslaved anyone. In my eyes everyone is the same and deserves a fair shot, but at the end of the day all white people are not bad and allowing people to blatantly accuse you of being racist without repercussion is what Facebook 100% supports and at times promotes though the classes you have to take as a employee.

Facebook has a policy that someone of color should be interviewed for every position, which is fine but I witnessed several times Asian and African American managers completely ignore someone who was white and more qualified and gave the job to someone of their own ethnicity. Out of the 10 times I saw that happen, 7 of those people were eventually fired cause they just couldn't do the job.

In summary, this attitude that white people are the root reason why every other ethnicity experiences problems is just flat out sad. Then it is taught and supported by companies like Facebook, which only separates us further. Out of any group there are bad apples, but that is no reason to come up with a blanket opinion and then teach that from generation to generation, that is the exact opposite of progression and being united.

A direct quote from my father in law (Who is black) ""Above being just black, more importantly I am an American, where you can make anything of yourself if you stop coming up with excuses and just get to work, white people are not the problem and we need to stop teaching our kids that they are"".",Racism works both ways and your HR team and managers don't support that. Teaching white people are the reason as to why a race is struggling is down right wrong and in my opinion it is racist and ignorant itself.

Summary:
- From the git-go, there wasn't even honesty about the job description, or even title, during the job interview. On my second day I learned that the position had a different name and dept than what I had been told. 
- There was absolutely no training for a highly complex role. We were just told to read the wikis. Except that a lot of things didn't exist in the wikis and you just had to go at it and hope it worked, and that any mistakes wouldn't set your projects back too much. 
- Despite the above, there was absolutely no leniency for taking a bit longer on your first projects. You were held to the same timelines as other team members that had been there months or years. 
- You were also held to the same timelines despite rapid changes being implemented to the system that caused weeks-long delays (e.g. longer review processes.) Somehow you were just supposed to compensate for them. 
- Expectations were not made clear at all - you didn't know you were failing at something until you were being told you could loose your job. 
- Rabid management that provided no support to you. The only purpose of my weekly meeting with my team lead was to be reminded that I could loose my job if I didn't produce enough. The manager would routinely flip out during team meetings and put a team members' position in question - in front of the entire team - for the smallest of mistakes. 
It was one of the most hostile work environments I've ever experienced. I literally ended up coaching multiple team members on how they too could leave their roles during my last week.","The workforce recruiting crunch is going to come back to bite Meta if employees and workforce culture are this hostile. Regularly threatening employees with job security, even if they're CWs, is only going to motivate them to look elsewhere, not perform well."

• Autonomy. Fb gives employees the freedom to make impact with very few (if any) bureaucratic guardrails. They trust their employees to make impact, so if I feel passionate about something I do it -- instead of first having to ask permission like I've been used to. 

• Diversity & Inclusion. FB doesn't just talk about the importance of DEI, they put the resources in place to actually make it happen. They have clear goals for the company to achieve diversity across the board (including within Leadership) and the provide proactive updates for how we're tracking. 

• Perks. The legends are true, but after more than a year still finding out about new benefits. Wellness award is my favorite and can be used to reimburse expenses for whatever helps you recover -- whether it's Spa Days, Ski Trips, or even an Apple Watch for tracking fitness.

• Career Growth. With the hyper growth opportunities for professional growth are abundant. 

• Too many others to include, but wanted to highlight some of the things beyond the normal 'glitz' you hear about (#Freefood #FacebookForty)","• Fast-paced, constant changes. While I personally love this about FB, I recognize there's a 'comfort' in knowing how your systems will operate day-to-day / week-to-week. With innovation there will be some misses, and if you don't have patience you will get frustrated.

• With the fast pace, you need to be proactive to expect career growth.","Keep up the great work, and excited for the Metaverse!"

Or could I address some of the most ruthless and two-faced narcisstic coworkers with the most severe case of unconscious bias and fat egos you will ever encounter? Or is it really their fault or the company culture that made them that way? 

Its kind of like Squid games, but then you remember that the people you work with don't actually come from the most desperate lives who need to be fighting for their lives, just people with severe personality disorders/power trip and ego issues. I've talked to several designers on my team who were not happy, severely stressed, and felt super disparaged.","1. Accountability, learn to be consistant, and take a few courses in ethics/morality and logic. The amount of bald-face lies I encountered was just in one word...yuck.

- Compensation is excellent. There are few places that would pay an engineer more.
- Perks are amazing. And I haven't even tried the free food yet. (We're still working from home.)
- Fast paced.
- Engineers have extremely high autonomy. Engineers usually decide for themselves what projects to work on.
- Employees are very optimistic and regard most problems to be solve-able. We are always trying to innovate and improve.
- The middle-managers are some of the best I've ever seen at any company. They respect people and seem to really care about their well-being and career goals.","- Expectations are very high. You have to be strategic about how you spend your time because there are so many expectations that it's hard to satisfy them all if you just do random work without thinking about how it matches the expectations list. This is kind of an annoying cognitive burden to constantly deal with because no one will directly tell you what to do. (See the point about autonomy, above.)
- If you like to be methodical or process-oriented, it can be frustrating at times because Facebook is the opposite of that. Most activities are ad-hoc and documentation is usually terrible or non-existent. Tools and infrastructure randomly break and you frequently have to troubleshoot them yourself.
- Software reliability is not the best, which means you frequently will be pulled into putting out some fire or preventing a crisis, rather than working on the thing you would prefer to work on.",I think it would be better to have fewer requirements in the PSC axes but make the expectations higher for the remaining requirements.

- Compensation is hard to beat

- Vast majority of people are very empathetic and smart
- Ability to change teams fairly easily","- Super toxic high achiever culture (there tends to be an attitude of ""Facebook isn't for everyone"" if you don't meet the absurdly high and intentionally ambiguous standards, even if it was for reasons outside your control)
- So much saying one thing but literally everything pointing the opposite direction (e.g. ""we're a strengths based company! just focus on your strengths!"" but performance evaluations are designed to evaluate uniformly and will hyper-focus onto the smallest weakness while ignoring strengths that balance it out)
- Facebook's idea of diversity is only skin deep (i.e. race and gender). They completely turn a blind eye to other forms of diversity like disabilities, neurodiversity, age, culture, etc when it means that any action needs to be done to address unfairness and implicit bias.
- Expectation to promote within specific timelines until E5 but the timelines are fairly short and don't take into account different learning speeds
- The higher level software engineer you are, the less you get to code and the more you're expected to project manage. Honestly I'm not sure why Facebook bothers to hire PMs if they just force engineers to project manage anyway.
- Performance evaluation system was designed to be as ""fair"" as possible by evaluating against uniform standards, which ironically makes it extremely unfair if you don't conform to the average, even if your coworkers and manager chain think you're delivering impact and providing unique value that would be hard to replace
- Talks a big game about work/life balance but there really isn't much because of how much it invades into your personal life
- Your success is almost entirely based on your manager because that's how it was designed. If you have a bad manager, you're SOL and your only options are switching teams or dealing with it. It's also common to have many manager changes and it's not that unusual if they only stick around for a half, leave, and then you're ""managed"" by an overwhelmed skip who probably won't be able to represent you accurately at performance reviews or make much time for you.

Friendly people (at least on the surface)","What I find most annoying and frustrating (found other IC4 or 3 DEs also share the same frustration) are: 
1 - The role: Like someone else mentioned I can’t see why we have ‘engineer’ in our title. It’s like 80% of your day goes about project management, expectation management, navigating team and product priorities, finding work for yourself and just what you need to do next. Then keeping others and yourself updated about what’s going on. When you can get a break from constant meetings and notifications and pings in chat then you can get some work done (Hello overtime). Also put aside time for advertising yourself, writing posts about what great things you are going to do, doing now, and have already done. Add a ton of stress on top of that for delivering IMPACT and constantly wondering if what you are doing is going to create enough noise to get you somewhere.
2 - Lack of well defined projects: you have to put in so much time and energy just to find something to work on. It’s like a manager decides they need some more headcount on their the team and hire the person and then tell them I don’t know what you need to do but there’s something out there for sure, go find out! Good for you if you can find or define a new impactful project, otherwise take on someone else’s work which they abandoned for something with more IMPACT or start working on some product that’s not going anywhere but some vp cares about.

Other things to consider: 
- The role : Data Engineers at FB are in a tough position. Usually noone in other roles really know what you are supposed to do, even DEs themselves will have a bootcamp course to tell them what they are supposed to do. As such you are always in the position of pushing back on requests, trying to define what you should do, or seeking to do the job someone else is already doing but in a better way. If you fail to push back you’ll be flooded with meaningless work (adhoc requests).

Other cons:
- Lack of Knowledge sharing and documentation: A piece of info you seek could be in a post on workplace, stored on some random quip, a file on dropbox, a sheet on google drive, or some random wiki page. And when you find it you can never trust what you see because it is possibly wrong or already outdated. Better to directly ask someone and hope they have the correct answer to your question. Enjoy waiting for responses or not finding any available time on their calendar to book a meeting.

-Moving Fast= Tons of junk: Moving fast to deliver short term impact has plagued the analytics org with tons of garbage. Noone cares about optimizing their solutions or documenting their work, and when they get credit for the IMPACT they move on to the next thing. Good luck if you inherit someone’s work which you need to make sense of on your own.",

For mid-career professionals (L5-L6 in particular), advancement is tougher as the company gets bigger/evolves; seems like there are more growth opportunities for junior levels (in terms of promo: L2/L3) and senior levels (in terms of new areas of learning/expansion: L8/D1+).

- Metrics driven culture
- Global impact
- Lots of teams to choose from","- Terrible WLB: This depends on the team but generally FB hires less people per product compared to peers, so the amount of work is always high for PMs. Privacy, compliance, integrity, policy and similar regulatory stuff, albeit much needed, has added a ton of work, but the expectation of shipping fast is still there. Which means no WLB. Many 15+ hour days in a month are common.
- Low growth: Hard to become a people manager in this company unless you’re really lucky.
- Leveling is a total mystery. People who advance are usually those whose managers are willing to give them a great review at any cost.
- Middle management is filled with old timers who've never worked anywhere else, or some people who probably got in because they knew someone. Decision making is horrible leading to a lot of teams with tons of churn and low morale.
- No patience to build lasting products. Projects that need nurturing are shelved and the only ones that continue are those that Zuck personally cares about. You have 6 months to show massive progress, or else your product is done. 
- Reorgs are as common as oxygen at FB. This causes a ton of headache to have to re-start every so often.
- Business has serious headwinds due to things like signal loss caused by privacy climate and anti-trust legislation.","- Do an audit of middle management and let go of people with terrible reviews.
- Find ways to grow product managers
- Focus on WLB of your PMs by hiring more, being more realistic on timelines.
- Invest more in long-term bets and stop re-orging every 6 months.
- Your 5 values say nothing about being supportive to one another, creating a workplace that people love working at and that shows in the way your culture has evolved."

You can almost live on campus. I guess I mostly spent on rent and gas. Free food, showers, gym, ~700 dollars on external wellness activity, paternity leave, and lots of small perks to simplify your life.

FB fosters quite a friendly culture. At least, on the level of engineers. Semiannual reviews partially evaluate how good your relationships with the colleagues.

FB is very good at employee retention. Management will try hard to find interesting projects for you. Lots of projects that may bring a great impact. Quite unique projects at scale. 

Lots of pocket communities with interesting activities.

Good compensation.","Lots of big politics around the company. There is always pressure from the government, society, the media, and even from own employees represented by a vocal left-leaning group. You will also get the part of this pressure as an employee. 

Noisy environment. Sometimes it's good to have people around, but often you'll find yourself distracted. The company likes open spaces, MPK 20 is a living nightmare, though MPK 21 was designed better.

No digital nomad options, except big work-from-home mode right now.

Code quality is diverse. Some open-source libraries/frameworks are brilliant. Check folly or react. The non-public part totally depends on the team.

HQ, the biggest part of the company, is located in Menlo Park. The place has a nice nature around but has certain issues with the rent price, infrastructure, and gender ratio. Young unmarried man should think twice before moving to the Bay Area, .",

Creative teams across the company are very white, and mostly male. While I'm excited to see more roles open up in Facebook for creatives, I worry that it affords teams and management opportunities to hire more white people. Instead of bringing in someone with a different experience that is talented and deserving of an opportunity. Sadly, I've seen BIPOC candidates get shortlisted, only to not make the cut for arbitrary reasons. 'Not a good fit' is a poor reason for someone who spent the time interviewing with us with a stella portfolio. I worry that teams are only bringing in certain candidates to meet some sort of quota or to appear ""exhaustive"" in their search, just so that they can hire another white person. I'm tried of observing these performative acts of diversity from creative leaders across teams and hope that this changes. We can do better, we should do better.",Introduce more ways to hold teams and creative leaders accountable so that we are continuously assessing the health of the culture here at Fb.

I came from another large tech company, and there is no comparison in terms of the way employees are able to bring their authentic selves to work.

Make no mistake, however, working at Facebook is not easy, and it's not for everyone. In my mind, these things are still pros, but definitely need to be called out - super fast-paced, high bar for excellence, a ton of autonomy and freedom, and huge opportunity for impact. The opportunity is there to do amazing things at Facebook, you just have to grab it.","Although we are a very large tech company, sometimes we still think we are a start-up. There are processes that one would think should be in place by now that are not. Ways of working can be complex with lots of gray areas that can sometimes slow work down.

The company is very unprofessional in its working style where there is little teamwork and many people who try to dump the hard work on you while they chase revenue gains for the review cycle. There is no real career progression and management will do musical chairs and swap your role. I only got to do what I thought I was hired for 18 months.

No matter how big of a fish you have been in previous ponds, you will be a small fish here and have incredible space to grow. There is incredible freedom to pursue the projects you want in the way that you want as long as you can defend why they are important to the company. While less than it was in the past, there is incredible transparency and accountability from leadership internally. Your manager will support and promote you in a way that is unprecedented at most other companies. Most importantly, the work you do affects millions or billions of people - even seemingly tiny tasks like making the app update 1 second faster or tweaking a model to deliver 1% more interesting content can have a large positive impact on the world. While it doesn't always succeed, the company takes diversity and social justice seriously and it shows in project initiatives and hiring.","It's a big company with entrenched (if sometimes informal) power structures. As much as people try to be transparent, there are backdoor politics that affect your role and career that you might not learn about until much later, if ever. There will be constant pressure to specialize - many of the new skills I've developed here would transfer well to other big tech companies, but be wasted at a startup. Work life balance can go sideways quickly unless you protect yourself zealously. Even in the ""move fast (and we no longer say 'break things')"" culture there is a lot of pressure to not mess up in ways that affect the public negatively - even small mistakes in privacy or integrity have terrible negative effects on potentially millions of people.","Get way ahead of privacy and integrity trends - we're usually reactive to anything that affects the top line, we should do a lot more speculative research on ways to protect free speech, squash misinformation, and protect user identity - all at the same time, even though those things often trade off poorly."

You can find community, have a voice and use your time to make real impact. There are endless teams to work on including some that aren't even in existence today, so your career has the opportunity to evolve as you do as an individual. I've enjoyed being able to network with people from different backgrounds, industries, etc. who help me think more broadly and strategically to source and engage diverse talent for open roles.","As the company grows, there are a lot of moving parts/team and things pivot quickly.

- Open source is not valued. Open Source is only done when the company sees a direct benefit like sharing code with vendors or when an advocate is willing to fight through all the red tape
- The company advocates a work/life balance, but expextations are not reasonable for a 40 hour week
- Code quality is extremely low. There is little empasis on quality so long as it works
- Developer and process tooling is all custom and buggy resulting in a lot of externa workarounds
- Internal training is low quality and external training is the same budget as swag. There is no tuition reimbursement
- The company says to be your authentic self, but if you don't drink the Kool-aid you're going to have a bad time
- The company is driven by semi-annual performance reviews that create perverse incentives which emphasize impact over quality and short term over long term goals.
- There are too many meetings and most are run inefficiently
- The company uses Workplace (Facebook for work) for internal communications which, like Facebook, has a low signal to noise ratio unless you ignore most things
- The company is process heavy in many areas but the only way things get done is when people ignore the processes",Listen to employee concerns. Embrace a more mature culture.

- Caliber of talent.

- Disparate tooling ecosystem and preference for homegrown tools over enterprise tools (which has lots of positives, but in many regards it means reinventing the wheel and bugs)
- Siloed teams working on similar things, but not knowing of or talking to each other

The other main con is information overwhelm. As a social media company, Facebook is in a unique position to influence and have a stake in social issues that have global impact. For better or worse, that means divisive opinions in the world coexist and are surfaced within the walls of the company and all over our internal workplace.

The result is that some teams take ""done is better than perfect"" and ""ask for forgiveness rather than permission"" to another level, which can make work tedious. Almost everyone comes from elite schools and has great stats so some really lean in extra hard into making themselves stand out, sometimes in ways that aren't the most useful or healthy. 

There's also a hierarchy Technical people on top, then Business people (cause they make the money) then lawyers then everyone else. People in ops often are at the bottom of the totem pole.

Transferring internally can be especially challenging, as there are no extra considerations for internal hires.",Incentivize building good products rather than launching things as quickly as possible.

Gaslighting is exactly what is the culture that is imposed top-down by management. It starts at the bootcamp. There, you'll be properly brainwashed how cute and cuddly Facebook is, how unfairly it is being treated by everybody, how great and kind the Czar and his ruling gang is, and how grateful and privileged you (a despicable useless worm) should feel to be here! Right there, in the bootcamp, they will start the abusive treatment by telling you ""why on Earth did we hire you? You do not submit any code during last 24 hours!"" This abuse and fostering of your impostor syndrome will keep going on. Typical Facebook-style management is when you are being repeatedly told ""I have no idea how did you got here, and if how come you were not fired yesterday - but OK, we'll give you one more chance"". This is part of this culture! 
There is a STACK RANKING! It's in tooling, in manager training materials! The fact that Facebook officially denies doing it is a yet-another confirmation that this company doesn't shy away from crime. Stack ranking means that all colleagues see each other as a competition. When I started my job at Facebook, my closest colleague didn't want to talk to me, because he knew that the better I succeed, the worse is for him. This is very profound and affects everybody: it's a hostile work environment. 
Performance reviews is a complete sham. There is one ""axis"" which is related to your actual performance. The other 3 (three!) axes (direction, etc.) is a complete baloney, and can be used to justify ANY rating for anyone. All managers are deeply ignorant schmoozers. 

Cult means there are plenty of taboo topics for which you'll be fired. There are, for example, internal ""non-managers"" groups, which are patrolled for any signs of dissent. If a person posts anything out of line there, this gets straight to his manager and HR. 
HR is the worst people I've met. They enforce the authoritarian rule ruthlessly and with cynicism. 

Working at Facebook has permanently damaged my faith in humanity. I realized that people can still do horrible crimes, given enough brainwashing. That people can treat each other like animals, given stack ranking. I wish I never joined this scam of a company, a lousy swamp filled with ghosts who pretend to be humans!",

- Since traditional EE roles dealt more with things like Oracle development, you can get the feeling that EE is looked down on by SWE orgs.

We get the opportunity to work on very impactful projects. In our area we support the efficient and accurate payment of many billions of dollars per year. It's a great responsibility.

One of the great things I love is being able to work on software engineering projects in Austin for Facebook.

The growth in Austin for Enterprise Engineering is also a great opportunity for me and my team - we get to be the ones determining the work culture here for engineering.","Ramping up within the domain takes some time. I wasn't immediately knowledgeable about things like the general ledger, period close, accruals, balance sheets and the like.

That is no different than any other company but it can be night and day here.

Generally here are the Pros
- People: Majority of the other Facebookers are of high quality and surrounding yourself with other smart people can only up your own game.

- Benefits: Positive package here overall. They take care of your health, make some life task much easier and try to make life more comfortable.

- Technology: Innovative mindset is a big plus but recent years have been more mirror moves with competition to gain an advantage. Good move but for those that want to break the glass into new frontiers, you got to pick the right team.

Impact: The opportunity is there for you to embrace.","Generally here are the Cons:
- People / Culture: There is a small minority of leftist that can be loud and push activist agenda's that are in your face. While my own goals can align (leftist) I don't like their approach. This is just society creeping into the corporate world and is seen across Tech in general. It can be toxic and extremely disrespectful. You might find more of this at Facebook due to the nature of the product. Imagine the rest... Pick your team wisely.

- Weak Leadership: Lot of new leaders... Experienced leaders may not have much experience with trouble shooting negative situations and come in with a bias. Another point here is the number of Re-Orgs. You might experience multiple changes within a quarter / half and this can drag on for years. 

- Negative news cycle ... it can be draining but it should be a wake up call to further innovate for a product for today. However... this news cycle is long... I mean looooooong and can be intense at times.","Think longer than 6 month windows.

- Workload: My tech lead set deadlines that were too aggressive and didn’t listen when my teammates and I pushed back, so we were constantly behind schedule. Working late at night and on the weekends consistently was required just to remain a few months behind schedule.
- Asking for Help: Several members of my team had to ask for help writing code many times per day. Most of their questions could be quickly solved by typing a few words into a search bar and looking at the first result, but they still asked another engineer any time they encountered something they didn’t already know how to do. They would intentionally not ask managers and avoid asking for help while managers were within earshot.",Pay attention to signs of burn-out in employees. Give more positive feedback and don’t largely focus on negatives. Work on improving the blame culture.

Meta,5.0,1,more than 1 year,Excellent Place to Work,2020-01-10,Production Engineer,"Menlo Park, CA",2,2,2,"The opportunity that Facebook offers for autonomy and career growth is incredible; coming in as a new grad PE I have the opportunity to grow based on merit and performance, not time in the role. 

Flexibility in when I work, how I prioritize my projects, and the scope of my work is invigorating and makes me excited to come to work each day. The company is mission-driven to a great extent, and I have been impressed with the way we have owned up to prior mistakes and fixed them head on. 

The Production Engineering role is well respected within the company, and the importance of reliability and scaling increases as our services reach more of the world. As a PE you will gain the knowledge necessary to build and operate real hyperscale systems capable of providing services to billions of people.

My team is comprised of some of the smartest, experienced engineers I have ever met - some of which have been building Linux services since 0.01. Even though sometimes working at Facebook feels like drinking from the proverbial fire hose, I am grateful I have the opportunity to learn from some of the top people in their field. For example, in bootcamp I took a command-line efficiency class from Jim Meyering, one of the maintainers of coreutils and also a Facebook employee.

Many other people have commented on this, but the perks and compensation are still top-notch. The company helps take care of your life so you can focus on work while you're working.","Facebook hires the kind of people that expect a lot from themselves. Despite some reports, you do not need to work long hours in order to succeed at Facebook. Bootcamp gives you the chance to find a team that matches you well, and new hires should come in intending to join a team where they can both find balance and grow in their career.

The company is growing and there is some sentiment around slowing down, but most engineering teams are still bottom-up driven and innovating in their space. The things we are doing around privacy and AR/VR are on the bleeding edge and we are strong leaders in these areas.

On the other hand, ironically, there is also sentiment around moving too fast as a company. Since we are people- and product-focused (as opposed to engineering-focused, like at Google), our primary goal is to impact the lives of people for good. Sometimes this means we opt for rapid prototyping over beautifully designed code. However, we are doing much better at recognizing better engineering work such as cleaning up code and improving monitoring, especially in the PE role.","As is the case with many large companies, some middle management fails to display leadership to a large extent. We should hire better senior managers and directors to embrace and evolve and relay the company vision and values."

Facebook rewards ambition.","The appeal quickly wears off. Your experience at Facebook highly depends on the team you join.

Facebook does not have the best people managers. If you join a team with a good manager who knows the system, you will be more likely to have a productive, prosperous time at Facebook. If you join a team with a bad manager, your work-life balance will be horrible. You will feel extreme pressure with the Performance cycle review every six months. Worse yet, you may even blame yourself for what's happening, not realizing the role your manager plays until it is too late.

Facebook is a good company for new college graduates. Even with a bad experience, you can learn so much about practical, applied technology here. For those with several years of experience, or with family commitments, be careful. Come into Facebook with a clear sense of what you need from Facebook that you cannot get anywhere else. Be prepared to leave when that is delayed, or not a possibility, or comes at a cost to your family or external commitments.

For most people, Facebook is not a company that you join and happily work at for the rest of your life. Facebook is a temporary stop that will squeeze as much productivity out of you as it can. When that stops, it forces you out or makes you want to leave.",

I was lied to multiple time by management. I was told my rating depended on the reviews from my peers, but then when the perf came, I realized it is 100% up to the manager regardless of what your peers say. My manager told me constantly I was doing great, then perf came and because I questioned the principles, I had a bad rating. The 360 was useless, management can use if they want to promote you, but if you are not in great terms with your manager, the 360 will be ignored. 

I was also told multiple times, the company is impact-based and that what matters is impact.

Meta,5.0,1,,Pleasantly Surprised,2016-02-16,Site Selection Program Manager,"Menlo Park, CA",2,2,2,"I'm a 55 year old working in a company where the average age is 28, and I've never been happier. I have always wanted to work in a company where I wasn't the proverbial square peg, and after nearly 30 years in the work force, I believe that I have found the company that complements my ideology for how a company should operate. Here are the ""Pros"" as I see them...

- Leadership: Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Chris Cox and the rest of the leadership team. Inspiring, smart and totally real.
- The Culture: The openness is a real thing, we're trusted to do the right thing, mistakes are expected, being yourself is important and encouraged, humility is encouraged and expected, building trust is paramount, the mission of making the world a more open and connected place isn't just a cool phrase because it guides everything. It's not about us, it's about everyone else.
- The People: Smart and nice is what I find. The diversity is better than any other company I've worked at and it's getting better. Those that are figuring out how to make what we do better for everyone are really good at implementing their ideas. Two years ago I didn't know what this company really was or if it had a secure future. I can clearly see now that they have what it takes to last, and it's sincere.
- Management: Managers are hired because they're good managers and not because they're good at something else. The management track is different than the contributor track and they're equal in importance.
- Benefits: Working in the Valley it's hard to differentiate all the benefits employees receive and Facebook is at least equal to all the major tech companies, but coming from Seattle the benefits are nothing short of incredible.

Granted, I haven't been with the company for very long and I'm still in the honeymoon period, but I can tell what's real and what's not; this place is for real.","Like any tech company, the work is big and complicated so work/life balance can suffer from time to time. The difference is that it's the passion within the individuals that drives them to work long hours and forego time off. Of course there can be times when schedule demands force the imbalance, but it's not such that 10-12 hours days become commonplace and expected regardless. We do what we do to get the job done; no one is killing themselves because there's an order to do so.

Being able to eat to your hearts/stomachs content can be dangerous to the waistline, but that's a self-control thing and not the company's issue.","Keep doing what you're doing and fight hard to not be complacent. I believe that humility is the key so don't ever lose that thinking. Your motives will always be suspect, but if you're able to look in the mirror everyday and know that your motives are pure, that's all that matters. Walking the talk is the best evidence there is."

Rampant hostile political atmosphere
Team leadership and IC's will undermine and berate service team members to push their agendas forward. This is often overlooked by leaderhip and results in burnout and lack of empathy from everyone. This in turn produces subpar results and half-baked solutions. No one wins.

Sloppy processes
It's a benefit of a doubt to even say there are processes. Most of the internal processes are poorly documented and no one has or wants to give time to onboard new hires (see comment below on the culture driving self-absorbed motives). Getting anything done is 60% figuring out the best way forward, 20% fighting off the political backlash from making said decision and not the one the loudest stakeholder in the room wanted, and 20% is actually spent doing the work. So much waste. No concept of agile or the fundamentals of development practices in parts of Community Operations.

No humanity in the human facing part of the org
Working in Community Operations often felt like working in a call center. People often don't care about their work and they don't care to look beyond the ""what's in it for me"" philosophy running the show to see the people that the organization is supposed to help. We're talking about posts around some of the worst stuff out there- and the lack of empathy around it is nauseating and explains alot of the trouble Facebook has been getting into.

Custom everything means sloppy everything
So many of the internal tools are custom- even the ones that don't need to be! Often the tools are under supported (or supported by a staff that isn't willing to take feedback) so you end up with subpar tools supporting a massive company that is in desperate need of some tools that are built with intent and full functionality behind them.

Culture breeds self-absorbed motives within people
Facebook's culture is oriented around ""impact""- what impact did YOU have this performance evaluation period. It's not enough to say that you helped remove content that was harmful to minors (as an example unrelated to my direct experience). The impact needs to tie back to numbers- how many lines of code, how much money was saved, how many productive hours were saved-- not one of the questions asked is about how it helps the PEOPLE that use Facebook. It is all inward focused on the individual contributor- and as such the individual contributors act accordingly. There is not team oriented thought or conduct in my experience across Community Ops. There is only ""What's in it for me?"" 

HRBP are often ill informed on processes and policies and rotate like the second hand on a clock
You never know what you're going to get with the HRBP group- some are warm and empathetic others are very clearly only there to protect the company (meaning they'll pigeon hole you into a defensive position). I didn't have a great experience with them and even in my exit process they got details wrong- like really important details. Kind of disappointing. 

Middle management is hijacking the company for personal gain and Upper Management hasn't caught on yet
When I hear Mark talk- I see someone who really does believe in the mission behind the company- to make the world a more connected place. But I'm not sure that he or his team see the snakes in the grass that are not aligned to that mission and only looking for ways to achieve their personal gain. It's frightening given how much power and authority Facebook has and I really hope that this issue is sorted before things go to far.","Be mindful of what behavior you are driving given the way expectations are set
Take a hard look at what Facebook says it wants to do and what it's really doing- are they aligned?
For Community Ops- the org is there to support the users of Facebook- the humans on the other side. I'd encourage you to take a deep walk into the org to see if the individual members are really thinking of those people when they do their work."

Meta,5.0,1,more than 1 year,"Fast pace, flat culture, great people",2019-10-23,Software Engineer,"Menlo Park, CA",2,2,2,"FB-unique pros:
- Super flat culture. Weekly Q&As with execs that are really open and casual, purposeful de-emphasis on titles. The emphasis is on ideas and impact; aspiring meritocracy
- Fast pace! Some view this as a con, but if you are high-energy and easily bored like me, this is ideal. Plus, this includes fast career growth. If you can perform, you will be rewarded quickly.
- Great people! ""Brilliant jerk"" behavior, as seen in these kinds of companies, is generally less tolerated/prevalent here than elsewhere
- Generally best engineering pay among big-tech employers


Less unique pros you've probably heard of (still awesome):
- Top-class benefits (including INSANE parental benefits)
- Amazing tech infrastructure, a great place to go very tech-deep
- Campus is basically Disneyland","- Recent newsmedia. It's easy to either feel discouraged or develop a bit of an ""us versus them"" mentality when the media/public seem both technically ill-informed and antagonistic towards your company.
- It's an increasingly mature company, which means the pace is (slowly) slowing down. This affects the culture; fewer people are mission-driven or down for a passionate ""hacker"" culture.","Keep up the [Mark's] recent push to ""take the offensive"" and evangelize the company's principles! Employees recognize the need for increasing work with regulators, but we broadly don't think that a continued ""apology tour"" is helpful (or warranted). We love being mission-driven and publicly aligned with you."

Fast promotion if you can work long hours. 

Fast paced environment, you'll get to learn new stuff all the time. Lot of smart engineers around.","With fast promotion comes fast firing. It's up or out policy up to a certain level. 

Not a good place for senior engineers joining. Too much stress in the team driven by performance reviews, which is the most aggressive that I've ever known. Emphasis is on individual impact, due to which there's lot of distrust within the team. No stack ranking, but a curve is implemented a org level. This is not a big deal in other companies but here it means 'out'. Managers main job is to write performance reviews, and this often leads to micro management that can be extremely frustrating to senior engineers. 

There's lot of work duplication, most managers (even directors) ignore it as performance reviews is all about impact. Most engineers know that everyone wants to write code and make impact, so ignore the code duplication.

Some teams are hiring just for the head count, not much impactful work. This becomes a problem for senior engineers as they have to invent work or get out. Before joining a team check out their roadmap for at least a year.

This is a good place if you want make money at the cost of WLB. Not a place to be innovative, which inherently carries risk and takes time. It's a risk because if there's no impact you'll be fired. Most of the engineers work to satisfy performance reviews. My work is determined keeping performance review as the guideline.

But company will be fine, lot of good engineers capable of quickly delivering a fix or hack a feature.",:)

Meta,5.0,1,less than 1 year,Great company to work at - do not believe to different news,2019-09-12,Senior Software Engineer,"Menlo Park, CA",2,2,2,"I work in company for 6 months, but I like how company works and operates. One of policies is an openness - this includes famous weekly Q&As. Senior management tries to explain the background behind decisions, so you know why one or another thing had to be done. 

In general everything focuses on making product which would be better for customers. There were a number of mistakes makes with privacy perspective, but there is a trend to improve this. This is very good approach - instead of hiding mistakes, company focuses on fixing them. After getting an offer I was not sure to join the company because of its reputation, but being inside I figured out most of this is an exaggerations to make a hype in news.

Work style is very flexible - you want to deliver new things, to make an impact, but from another perspective, it is not demanding and it is far from sweat factory in some other companies. It left time to learn something, you can attend many meeting remotely. Work life balance is very good - it is difficult to improve it without affecting the work (someone should do the work, right?). 

There are a lot of young people around (ex-students, but usually with great knowledge), but also there are still a number of experienced people - so aging doesn't seems to be a problem at FB.","Work style is open space. Many new buildings are awesome, while a number of old buildings are depressing - dimmed lighting, gray ceilings. Some buildings have a quiet policy, but for others it is not so good. I'd recommend remodel old buildings (hack, paint ceiling to a white, so it will reflect the light, install better lighting, work with designers!), split large rooms into smaller, team-sized rooms, add more VC rooms so people could easier get on conference call without disturbing others.

Another minus is hyper-concentrated campus in Menlo Park. It is difficult to find a good, reasonable-priced rent in that area. It works well for young people, but for families with kids there are a lot of other factors to be taken into account, so Menlo Park area just doesn't work.",It would be good to have another campus in East Bay - somewhere in Dublin / Pleasanton area.

- Impact.

You have to suggest eng team to apply your suggestion from analysis, and prove how much of the product growth are from your analysis. So sometimes your impact can be subjective.

- Skillset. You may be asked to do a lot of ad-hoc analyses from eng team, which I am sure are very important and can guide engineers whether to implement certain features, but that will prevent you from doing some deep dive analyses and learning some new techniques in data analysis. Maybe after a year or two, you will find that you did not build any statistical models or haven't touched any machine learning. But that's the skillset what other companies will ask for when you apply new job. Who cares you did how many ad-hoc analyses or AB test or wrote how many data pipelines.

My technical title was substituted with a non-technical ""specialist"" equivalent that paid less, resulting in a 20% bump in my salary when left, despite downgrading from a ""lead"" level position at Facebook to a ""senior"" level position at my current job.
* Management is often promoted based on seniority rather than competence.
* ""Most fast"" mentality leads to duplicated work, lack of documentation, and general confusion. Senior ICs are expected to spend much of their time project managing to make up for the failure in organization. I often found during requirements gathering for a project that part or all of it had already been done elsewhere and everyone had simply forgotten about it.
* The culture of open communication makes it seem like employee feedback is valued and encouraged, but actions are rarely taken on that feedback.

The above issues weren't as bad when I first joined, but my last year there was a nightmare filled with so much toxic stress and bad politics that I regularly broke down crying when I got home from work.

Meta,3.0,0,more than 3 years,"A great place to learn and grow, if you're lucky and find the right team",2019-02-12,Product Designer,"New York, NY",-1,-1,2,"- If you find the right team, and you have the autonomy to self-improve and grow, Facebook is a great place for you to flex your wings, experiment, and improve.
- By default, almost everything you ship is used by a lot of people
- Benefits are really good","- You work all the time. It's impossible to truly step away from work. I had dreams about FB projects until about 3 months after I left.
- If you don't end up on a good team, or with a good manager, you're out of luck in terms of ""upwards"" movement and ""impact"". It's really a dice roll unless you're privileged enough to select a specific team.
- Facebook itself is a well greased machine. It self-enforces a lot of its own problems we're seeing the outcomes of today due to how it works. It's unlikely to change that anytime soon, so if you don't like how FB is unable to predict externalities in its work at its scale, you'll be upset working there
- Working at FB is a bit like having blinders on. You're so dang busy and shipping things all the time, it is not conducive for you to think about the big picture and (related to above) the potential butterfly effects/externalities of your work. Many well-intentioned projects end up having disasterous consequences, but I'm confident that 99% of people out there, if they worked on the project, would've also been unable to predict the fallout. The prime example here is Instant Articles, which was a design-lead initiative to give select news partners the ability to make their articles load fast and render ""natively"" in the mobile apps (spun out of Paper after that got shut down). I can assure you that all the team wanted to make was a beautiful interface — it was lead by a product designer — and none of them would've wished to kill ad revenue/contribute to ruining journalism. You can argue that Instant Articles was one in many many steps FB took that ultimately shifted the ability to make money off of news ads from newspapers to FB itself, and lead to today's massive journalism layoffs and click-bait culture (if ya can't get clicks, ya can't get ad views, and ya can't make money). If you ever met the Instant Articles design lead, you'd know all they care about is a good design and polished interactions. But it turns out, just caring about that means you aren't thinking about the potential damage your product can do 4 years down the line.","Facebook's culture will never change. The recent Q4 earnings are a testament to how good the ""ship fast"" machine is printing money. Even a disastrous 3 year long anti-FB PR cycle didn't keep the stock down for long, which means the company won't make major changes to the way they work.

Here are the more radical ideas that will never be implemented:
- Zuck needs to go, or step back into a different role to just focus on his pet projects (which he has many). His low EQ trickles down through the company because all important projects live or die by the ""Zuck Review"", which he offers his gut views on the product. The man is not infallible, and cannot predict bad human behavior because he himself (and those around him) are only human, and have many flaws and oversights due to their background, location, wealth, etc.
- Build more ""local"" product teams. FB to this day insists on running product from HQ, whereas Lays and Doritos know that their American flavors will never work in Southeast Asia and create local flavors with a local team and local testing. Line is a Korean company that has a Thailand specific team to work on Thailand specific features. Facebook has never done this except for a ""project Japan"" to make FB more appealing to Japanese people in the late 2000s/early 2010s.
- Fire a ton of people. There is a lot of incompetence, especially at the management level

None of that will happen."

- Can feel like Facebook values outside hires more than inside talent already there

- work life balance is not great, but you don't come to facebook to ""Cruise"" if you do, you will be fired quickly 
- Newer PMs from other companies seem to be infiltrating a ""CEO"" role in their job -- which is not how Facebook operates. Collaboration > dictatorship of features and product. 
- The product specialist role specifically is challenging to stay in for longer than a few years -- the bar for performance gets higher, but you have the same ""quiver"" of tactics and tools and can only reinvent the wheel so much.

- Management needs more accountability. Anytime a project didn't ship or a team didn't do well, the leadership had a tendency to deflect blame on PMs, EMs and other ICs rather than leadership.

The culture is to blame as FB values tenure over experience. An IC with 2 years of FB experience and 0 years of life experience is perceived to be more valuable than a FB noob with 15 years of industry experience. It's akin to that one possessive and insecure person in a group of friends who gets down right hostile when a new friend enters the circle. I'm the only noob on my team so you can imagine my plight.

Speaking with a number of employees who left Facebook only to return once again, while no company is perfect, there is a lot that Facebook has to offer - not just in terms of benefits, but with the impact that our apps and services have on this world - for people and businesses alike. 

Our open culture is pretty amazing to understand the vision of our company and where we're heading. Leadership has been consistently transparent in ways that many other companies are not - even other tech companies - with weekly Q&As, open posts, and quarterly all hands. And they address tough issues or topics head on. 

There are a lot of career opportunities within the company - as we often refer to the ""jungle gym"" that you can take your career internally. There are incredibly passionate people who work at Facebook, and I never cease to be amazed by the level of intelligence and care demonstrated by my coworkers around the world to help our company deliver on our mission.","Particularly as of late, Facebook has been subject to a lot of negative press. While some of it may be deserved, a lot of it feels sensationalist. So employees have to develop a thick skin and resilience to a lot of this scrutiny and ensure that we are focused on the long-term, not just the short-term.

- Internal politics have drastically increased. There is a growing focus on optics vs. impact, which is incompatible with a culture that operates under ""Focus on Impact.""
- I found it difficult to express the company's values such as Be Bold and Be Open in a couple of organizations, because leaders who were external hires brought in a hierarchy, a ""CYA"" culture, and a combination of empire building and swim lanes.
- The culture in some organization is toxic – people feel unsafe voicing their opinions and being their authentic selves.
- Many teams find themselves blinded by metrics, still doing good work but missing the greater opportunities by ignoring clear paradoxes between metrics and customer experience.
- Internal transfer policies can be restrictive due to restrictions around leveling and performance. I know at least three people who left the company who wanted to move to a role that better suited them, but could not because they weren't meeting expectations in their current role (that didn't suit them).","- Spend time getting house in order – Build trust. Identify and remove toxic leaders throughout the organization, Meet with every employee to get pointed, specific feedback on team culture/management. Sure up buggy systems/processes before trying to launch the next feature or bring the next billion people on board.
- Don't attribute current political/data issues as the chief cause for employee attrition. The annual internal survey doesn't quite capture some of the cultural and operational frustrations that employees hold.
- Add more standardization to exit interviews – give them significant weight. This is an opportunity to learn the specific issues that are leading people to leave.
- Remove the pseudo-curve used in the performance cycle. Hard-curving a group of highly motivated, high-performing employees… doesn't serve its purpose."

If you're right out of college, this might be the place for you, but that's mostly because you wont have much work experience to compare it against.","1) the job I got is not the job I thought I was getting:
 As an engineer, with engineer in the title, and over 10 years of experience, I really thought I would get to do more engineering. Unfortunately, the job is really about 50% business analyst and 20% project management, and 30% engineering. You are expected to own every aspect of your project, regardless if anyone else actually does. Also, you're told you have the opportunity to choose the team you want to be on, but for me, that choice was removed at the last minute.

2) bad management, bad leadership - all managers are expected to be individual contributors which is basically another way of saying that they aren't particularly good at either, and do not have time to devote to both roles. Also, be prepared for mansplaining.

3) more money than sense: gobs and gobs of money are being thrown around. there's basically an offsite every other week. Nevermind about work, deadlines, or being competent, it's more important to go glassblowing. The pay is nice, in fact, its the best feature about the place.

4) the company that wants to connect the world would rather loose talent than have remote workers. no, seriously. say you're on a team, and your team decides to move to another office thats like 1 hour away. you are kicked off the team and put on another team. what sense does that make? new mom wants to wfh? not allowed. 
 Seriously, it's called skype, people. 

5) and speaking of teams, the team structure is completely whack. instead of having a core group of people I work with on many projects, I have a different group of people I work with on each project. a completely different set of swe, pm, ds, and de for each project. This completely limits our ability to grow more efficient with each project, let alone build any sort of a professional relationship.

6) you're not allowed to fix things that are legit broken. I've only been here a short time and have already had to suffer fools who prefer poorly designed metrics with political bs to actually measuring things properly. bug 1 told not to fix it - too big to fail, bug 2, never got fixed by other team, bug 3, too high profile to fix. seriously? why not just admit all your metrics are wrong?

7) people care more about performance reviews than actual performance. no really, if I hear the phrase make ""an impact"" I will vom. What this really means is not ""do good and useful work"" which is how it might be interpreted, instead it means that you should very little on the very high profile projects, and then post it everywhere, to make sure people NOTICE. Also, keep a log of your work so that you can share it with your absentee manager come review time - otherwise, he (yeah I said he) likely will have no idea what you worked on or why. But, instead of this being a meaningful signal, it just becomes more noise.","separate managers from IC. some of the best people I have ever worked for were not programmers.

stop focusing on impact, it sounds like a colon and its utterly meaningless

if it's broken, fix it. if your metrics change as a result, deal with it.

build a real team structure, and provide some actual leadership. 

focus on programming for real reasons. This stuff is far too random and scattered, and it gets abandonned 3 months after completion.

change job titles/descriptions to accurately reflect the work

stop having a blame and fear based environment - it does not lead to good code"

- endless food options
- global reach and impact

At Facebook, you have the opportunity to work on products that everyone uses. This helps you use and sharpen your skills in an entirely new way, and really think through your logic and decisions—unpacking every detail because you have to make sure it works and is understood across all demographics, countries, cultures, and languages.

They also take care of employees. Everything is free: shuttle rides, laundry service, professional development courses, tons of swag, and all the food, snacks, and drinks you can eat (the “Facebook 15” is real). The company’s health benefits are unmatched and they even have medical, dental, and gym facilities on campus.","- politics and back channeling 
- competitiveness and lack of collaboration 
- relationships hold more value than quality work

Facebook the company is like the platform: everyone acts like everything is great, but no one acknowledges or exposes what’s really going on under the surface. People act like it’s all sunshine and roses, but because there’s such a “focus on impact” and performance, it’s actually a competitive environment where people are out for themselves and scrambling for whatever projects will give them the most visibility—at Facebook, visibility > impact > high performance ratings > bonus multipliers + equity refreshers. 

As a result, people you know and being an influencer matter more than the quality of your work. Likes are the real currency and even though you’re told to “be your authentic self”, one type of person benefits most: those who are extroverted, don’t rock the boat, and are oftentimes male.

While the actual benefits and perks are great, don’t be fooled by the glamour of it all: they’re also designed to keep you there and keep you working. You’ll be taken care of, but the focus on impact and performance makes it’s easy to forget to take care of yourself. There’s an undercurrent of anxiety in the culture that is very real and not often acknowledged.

Facebook is a great company for those just starting out their career. If you’re a seasoned professional, I suggest staying away. It doesn’t matter how much experience or expertise you have—I spent most of my time proving to people half my age that I knew what I was doing. 

Time and again, my suggestions would be ignored or edited to the point that they were no longer my ideas. Time and again, leadership would be shown those watered down ideas and say, “Nope!” Time and again, when I’d go back to my original recommendation, leadership would say, “That’s the one!” After awhile, it was finally time for me to say, “I’m tired of (and better than) this.”","You hire people for their expertise, so let the use it. And when people bother to speak up, listen. Stop ignoring the problems and waiting for those people to burn out and quit. The number of people who go on medical leave is a signal. Acknowledge it and pay attention."

Community is at the core of FB. I’ve never worked at a company that cares so much about its people. Taking care of yourself and working sustainably is part of the culture. All the amenities are there to keep you focused (or distracted). Food, snacks, multiple gyms (with classes), car service, life@ (I took my passport photos there for heavens sake). 

We have, workplace, FB’s own internal app. It’s like Facebook within Facebook for employees. I can message anybody and be in contact with anybody in the company. I’m an entry level engineer and talk to VPs Directors and even Mark, who holds open forum EVERY Friday in person. That level of access is phenomenal. 

If you have an idea you can do it. You have the support and finances to achieve whatever you can think of. If you’ve worked anywhere else then you can see why everything I’ve written is so important. It just isn’t like that anywhere else.","It’s so good that it would be hard to work anywhere else. I’m destroyed for life. If it’s your first job I would feel bad because this is NOT a true view of the working world. If you’re humble enough to appreciate that then you should be ok. I believe people can develop a degree of entitlement and hubris in this environment. You can run into folks like that, but the majority of others are great.","Mark is doing a fantastic job managing a service that over 2 Billion people use worldwide. The way FB has evolved so much so fast has brought a lot of unexpected uses. Stay the course, and don’t stray from what people love most about FB. Connecting with Friends and Family."

They have helped me improve my communication skills, people skills and empathy skills. The perks are absolutely ridiculous, from free charging for electric cars to amazing free desserts, and packed micro kitchens.","One of the reasons Facebook is in this sticky privacy situation is the complacency at the top. For many years, management has denied its social responsibility to moderate the content that appears, claiming to be an unbiased 'platform'. They ignore years of 3rd party studies that show that they are creating echo chambers.

Even after getting ""Exceeds Expectations"" cycle after cycle, I found it difficult to influence the top-down decisions. A group of engineers & analysts may prove a huge opportunity in developing a feature, with data and all, but if it's not the direction coming from the top, then it's unlikely to get resourced.

Meta,5.0,0,more than 1 year,"Open, fast, no bs",2014-03-17,Software Development Engineer,"Seattle, WA",2,2,2,"It might be easy to roll your eyes when people from Facebook say how open their culture is, but it's true; it's more open than any other place I've worked at. At a company wide-level, secret projects, public incidents, important non-public business metrics and the like are all openly discussed. You can ask questions about them directly to Zuckerburg at the weekly Q&A. I think the idea is that if everyone is on the same page or at least, differing views are heard, the company will be stronger, and solutions may be offered from a place you didn't expect. This is much different from previous companies I worked at, where discussions on internal email lists would be shut down by some lawyer saying that there's certain things that can't be discussed, and important data is divided up to groups and individuals on a ""need to know"" basis, etc. 

This culture applies at a lower level too. You feel comfortable giving feedback to each other about each other, about product decisions, about management, etc. The flipside of this openness is that you of course, have to be willing to receive the feedback, you have to recognize that while openness and feedback is highly encouraged, decisions have to get made, and actions and data are more valuable than words. At the higher level, since the company trusts employees with access to so much information, keeping such info confidential from the outside world is taken seriously.

It's a great place to work as an engineer. You're given a lot of freedom, but it's also a responsibility to make sure you're doing things that are valuable. You don't get much credit for working hard or being smart if you don't produce valuable output.

One cool thing about Facebook, in contrast to other comparable companies (Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, though in truth, FB is much smaller), is how they have a pretty singular focus. Even with the differing areas (including advertising and such), they do a good job of keeping their eye on their mission of connecting as many people as possible. I also think they are way more empathetic to their users than most people give them credit for. It seems like popular opinion has it that FB is arrogant and only cares about its users insomuch as they represent $-signs. From within the company, it didn't feel this way at all. I saw a lot of empathy towards users, and a lot effort spent to improve or things or fix broken things with no direct financial benefit. The strategy is not complex. The thinking is that if they can make FB easier and more fun to use, then more people will use it for more time each day (which will also have a network effect of attracting even more people to use it), then the advertising dollars will follow. Of course, it is true that FB wants to make the audience more accessible to advertisers as well, but there are a lot of people at FB who care about privacy and security.

They have really good infrastructure and really great ways to share the infrastructure and code. They have a lot of cool internal tools, and what they've built is really impressive, and more importantly, it helps your team build products faster without having to solve problems that someone else already solved. Every software company tries to do this, but FB seems to have been more successful with it. Perhaps it's because they're still relatively small, but if anything, I can at least say it is very cool while it lasts.

The perks and work environment are great, unless you're one of those types that can't stand open office spaces. I've worked in both a private office and open offices in multiple companies. While I do think a private office has some benefits, I mostly think it's a personal luxury for the employee and a huge waste of money for the company. I'd much rather have the money go into other areas like salary, benefits, and other workplace improvements rather than the added real estate necessary to have offices.

Of course, you've heard about the food and snacks. They have an amazing selection of great stuff, and what I like about it is that it sort of goes above and beyond expectations. Sure, some days, lunch is better than others, but I really can't complain, and the selection of drinks and snacks is amazing. It's not like you should work at FB just because of that, but it demonstrates FB's desire to make work as fun and convenient as possible.

You'll be surrounded by people who like being there. I can't think of a better environment to work in. If you have a giant ego, you may not like it as much. Respect is definitely given to those that have deep experience in the industry, and they are expected to lead others and mentor more junior employees. However, if for whatever reason, you can't perform at the level expected, no one is going to care if you did this and that at Google or shipped ten things at MS, etc.

FB also has a lot of fun events, and I made a lot of friends working there, so going to the events was fun. Also, if you're older and worried that FB is just a bunch of 22-year-olds, and that you won't fit in, I wouldn't worry about that. FB does have a lot of young employees (who are really smart btw), and it does hire a lot of people straight out of college, but it also attracts a lot of experienced engineers from other top companies like Google, MS, Amazon, etc.

Work-life-balance seemed totally normal to me. It may be different depending on your team, but I felt you could do 40-50 hours of work a week for the most part and you would be totally fine. It's about what you produce, not how hard you're working. Other team members who had children would work normal hours and go home at normal times. I didn't see any of these folks have a problem when they left early to take care of their child or things like that. Of course, there could be times that people are expected to work extra if something critical happens, but for the most part everyone wants to avoid this and this happens sparingly, from what I observed. Now, there were many times where I chose to work late myself, but I never felt any pressure to do so. The caveat is that there are on-call rotations, and in addition, even if you are not on-call, you are expected to be reasonably available if the on-call person needs your help. However, again, no one wants this, and your team will work on ways to avoid these situations.

The best thing I can say is that working at FB is about productivity. I didn't experience and political bs and it was a pleasure working with a group of people who were all concerned with producing a good product and making the best of the time spent while doing it.","FB expects a lot out of engineers, and you can't slack off. Of course, you shouldn't slack off at any job, but since FB is pretty fast-paced, there is a risk that you'll have trouble adjusting at first.

FB has a lot of custom infrastructure and tools, and prehaps more impressively, it works great. It makes doing your job really great, but on the other hand, you'll end up learning a lot of stuff that won't be applicable elsewhere.

FB's code-base is very good in some ways, but in other ways, it's not as great as some of the existing engineers think it is. I don't think this is that big of a deal, but the important part is that as an engineer, you need to quickly learn FB's values and practices and ""get with the program"" so to speak. If you don't like some things, then you just have to deal with it, as it's not likely you're going to change people's minds at this point. The nice thing is that things are at least very consistent.",You need to focus on how you are going to maintain the existing culture and protocols as you grow. I think this could be really tough.

Meta,5.0,1,more than 5 years,Respectful workplace. Impactful work. Great benefits.,2018-05-16,Project Manager,"Menlo Park, CA",2,2,2,"- The company really cares about upscaling their managers. As an individual contributor myself, I really appreciate having a caring and at the same time professional manager, who gives me a lot of flexibility, but steps in when I need them.
- You are being recognized for impact, not for how many years of experience you bring to the table. This helps getting good reviews for hard work, even when you're young and unexperienced.
- You get many opportunities to work cross-functionally, which is great for diversity of thought. Personally, I like the fact I am exposed to working with technical and non-technical people.
- Some of the benefits are amazing. Fertility treatment coverage and in general medical coverage are the best out there.","- Facebook purposefully hires very smart and ambitious individuals. Even when there's no pressure from the manager to work long hours, you often see people working long hours, which in return puts more pressure on you.
- There are no incentives to stay in the company for longer than 4 years. Once you vest all your RSUs, refreshers you get for good performance look very unattractive. It's more and more common for people to leave FB after 4 years, and come back a year later to re-negotiate their RSUs.
- You are being ""punished"" with certain benefits if both spouses work for Facebook. A good example is baby cash which you get per family, not per employee. 
- Commute in the Bay area is terrible.

There are many professional development opportunities to allow you keep growing. The perks could be a pro like free food, laundry, salon, etc. but I personally found it to feel like the company wants to keep you there instead of going home and having social interactions with people outside of Facebook. But, if you don' t have a strong social support network, it's a great set up. My co-workers were by far the best part of the company!","The hiring process is very strange as they hire people without knowing what team they'll be on, allowing for an opportunity to be placed on a team that's not a great fit, and then being stuck in it and not being able to move around until at least a year in. HR seems most concerned about protecting the company rather than really listening to employees and their concerns. There is a lot of turnover lately...I had 4 managers in about a 9 month span, which leads to really confusing situations. They also keep bad managers in their positions, even if there have been multiple concerns raised about them from a whole team. The values the company promotes are great in theory, but I don't see them in practice.","Promote middle managers internally - the more you bring external hires in, the more the company culture erodes, as these external people are stuck in their ways and not willing to do things the Facebook way, and the way ICs are told to expect things in bootcamp creating a total misalignment between expectations and reality. Also, when you know someone is a bad manager, remove them for the situation instead of allowing them to continue to lead their team astray or throw their ICs under the bus. After all, managers have the ability to have more positive or negative impact than an IC, but they have multiple safety nets built around them to protect them whereas ICs are on their own. Lastly when employees indicate they're interested in moving teams don't ask them to weather the storm for another 6 months in hopes that the next manager will make things calmer - listen to what they are experiencing that's making them want to switch teams and have a more appropriate work/life balance and a better experience with their manager."

It's a place to explore your passions with classes in the arts, a music room, running clubs, health center, etc. Everything is at your fingertips.","The recruiting team here is over 1000+ people and going up. Like someone else mentioned, the quality of hires for the recruiting team is worsening. The R4R team is so desperate to hit their goal that the bar is low and it shows. There are many new inexperienced recruiters that we just wish would or COULD do their basic, functional job. 

The role of a sourcer and recruiter is becoming smaller and smaller. And although leadership insists they care, every action they take suggests they do not. It is hard to constantly be reminded that you are merely just another number to be replaced asap. 

Be prepared to work long, long hours. There isn't such a thing as ""work/life"" balance as most in recruiting will work into the night and weekends. The goals and expectations are extremely high so you're constantly competing with a whole org of overachievers. Realistically, this means it'll be tough to even achieve a ""Meets All"" rating during the review cycle as everyone is overachieving, thereby changing that already high goal.","It's becoming a toxic environment, so please figure this out before your top performers can't take anymore of this. This canNOT just be considered as a ""growing pains"" problem."

I don't regret joining FB:

- I've learned an incredible amount about a new tech stack and product management for ads in only a few months. Not all my peers are brilliant about all things (which is good, as I'm certainly not) but every one of them is smarter than I am about at least one thing, and it takes very little time to find out what. 

- Data and logic rule here -- not always, not entirely, but enough. There is enough of a culture of rigor to metrics that we still have a North Star when in the weeds.

- The perks are great. I have gotten broken glasses fixed by the dry cleaner for only a low tax rate. The food is shockingly good for the scale of the cafes, and I'm impressed every day by the whole MPK service operation.

- Workplace is much better than emails as a site for debate/discussion about what to do. Also a con, because it generates a game of how-should-i-react-on-Workplace all its own, and in a more public record.","Facebook is like Bitcoin: people in it ask when you bought in because it's the easiest way to find out how powerful you are without being rude. 

I joined within the last year, along with about half of the company. The contrast in the level of success of people who joined N years ago vs N-2 years ago is logarithmic for all values of N. At its current rate, I don't think I can advise anyone to join now, and after I vest, I'm not sure I will stay.

Part of this is that the starting comp isn't very good. The vesting stock is, but the cash is fairly mediocre (less than previous jobs I've had at far less profitable companies), and vesting accelerates over time. This nets to you being paid much more than before, year over year.

The much greater share of it is that opportunities scaling in the same pyramid-growth path means that anyone thinking of joining today can't expect any of the same trajectory that available 2 years ago, and maybe even 1 year ago.","Most brutally, to many of the leaders in Ads and elsewhere: Your job is to set strategy and standards, ask aggressive and important questions in reviews, debug high-level problems before they hit the front page of the NYTimes, and find the right resources for your teams. It's not to write leadership manifestos about how to feel inspired. People will upvote soft memos when they're posted, and there's a growing culture that feels they have to to be on your good side. Fight that temptation and show that intellectual rigor and shipping impact, not pandering, still holds the day.

In so far as your job is to lead culture, it's also to build a culture that values people for their experiences *before* Facebook. In a company growing this fast and hiring at the middle, not just the bottom, we will have to agree that outside experience matters, or new employees will waste months if not years earning their stripes to prove their code and analysis and strategy and diffs are credible, too. And while there is onboarding time for everyone, this period is navigated alone here much more than it is in hierarchical organizations with mentors/mentees, year cohorts, other structures to force learning, and this lack will be more and more unsustainable as hiring accelerates over the next years."

* Really awesome internal tools
* Unbelievable compensation & perks
* The company trusts & believes in its employees
* You become associated with the Facebook brand
* Also a con, but you have a ton of freedom in what you work on","The tl;dr is Facebook is a big company and its cons reflect that. The company mission and values are incredibly admirable, but have become increasingly difficult to implement as the company has grown.

* You might find yourself working on a project with over a million lines of code, but nobody on your team has written more than 10,000. The need to sit down and figure it out yourself can be pretty stressful in an environment that is pushing you to ""make an impact"" and be constantly shipping new features. 
* The few senior engineers (in my org at least) show little interest in mentoring more junior engineers.
* Sink or swim mentality among engineers, the mega-teams supporting products in the core app can be brutal and unwelcoming.
* Launch decisions are very political - criteria for launching a change is opaque, and feedback from department leads happens far too late in the development process (often in the meeting where a launch decision is being made!). Little has been done to fix these issues despite it being constant feedback for the past year.
* Performance reviews put too much emphasis on immediate personal output rather than collaboration and assisting other teams. This causes teams and individuals to focus inwardly. While it's never been malicious, I've seen this behavior directly harm other team's productivity or metrics.
* Work/life balance is below average on the day-to-day, but oncalls are truly awful.
* Decision-making has become a bit too distributed between orgs and reflects in the overall product.","* Pay close attention to teams that have poor retention and take drastic measures to reverse the vicious cycle (the less seniority on a team, the faster the turnover rate becomes)
* I think there is a gap between what's best for the company and what is rewarded in performance reviews. Fixing performance reviews (starting with incentivizing mentorship & collaborative behavior) will likely fix many of the current problems at Facebook."

Meta,5.0,1,less than 1 year,Best Large Tech Company Culture,2017-12-05,Software Engineer,"Menlo Park, CA",2,2,2,"From the start, Facebook has been amazing.

Bootcamp was a great experience; not too many companies let a new grad spend 6-8 weeks searching for a good team fit. They let you pick a team, which essentially means you get to pick your tech stack (Backend; Front-end; Mobile; Infrastructure), the org you work for (Messenger, Facebook, Oculus, Instagram, etc.). More importantly, you get to pick your manager + team mates, where as in other large companies, it's the other way around; you are assigned to a product & org & manager whether you like it or not. This is way different compared to Google's opaque 'host matching' process and Microsoft where they just randomly place you in a division like Azure or Office.

The company values really shine through every day. Before Facebook I thought the concept of company values was kind of corny and B.S. Now that I'm at FB I can at least say that here the company values are actually values held by top management + majority of the workforce and not just marketing / HR speak.

Everyday I really feel like we are moving fast and shipping a lot of product very quickly. We A/B test lots of features, analyze the data, and swiftly decide what to ship to the public. I never feel stuck; I always feel like I'm either implementing an A/B test or analyzing data so we can ship more features. There are not long product cycles with lots of prognostication from product leadership; we build, measure, then learn. Thats it.

I feel everyday that we have an open culture. At Facebook, we use Workplace, a tool thats kind of like Facebook but for corporations, made by you guessed it... Facebook. Within Workplace, just like normal FB, there are a ton of groups. I'm in a bunch of groups and basically get visibility on decision making + product updates + news from every part of our org. I feel like I'm in the loop and just learn so much about FB / product by reading my Workplace newsfeed. For example, today I read a research report about internet users in India, learned some stuff about dynamic ads, and saw one of the senior leaders announce a new partnership deal. All of that info isn't directly relevant to my day-to-day job, but because its all there and open to anyone, I learn so much and have so much clarity into FB's product vision & company objectives. Mark or Shreyl do Q & A's every Friday. Between hearing top leadership speak, and reading updates from every part of the company on Workplace, I feel that FB is a very open and transparent place to work.

There are many other pros and cultural values that I like but let me get to a major pro to end this review. Food!
Here's just a sample from today! I ate these 3 meals today at the company cafe 2 mins walk away from my desk. 

Breakfast: 
Soft Boiled Egg + Been + Cheese + Salsa Tostada. Organic Blueberries & Blackberries. Hemp & Pumpkin seeds.

Lunch:
Vegetarian Pho with Sous Vide Eggs, Tofu, Steamed Cabbage, Green Onions, Cilantro, & Bean Sprouts in it. Added Sriracha and Chili Oil to spicen it up.
Thai Iced Tea Bobba (Bubble) Tea. 

Dinner (today was Jamaican themed):
Sweet Potato & Corn Casserole, Collared Greens, Fried Plantains, & Quinoa. 
I also got a slice of cheese pizza :)

Dessert: Mango Cheesecake made with Graham Cracker Crust. 

By the way, the menu rotates, and at the HQ, there are a ton of cafes to choose from so way more options for food are there.","Work life balance is tough. Can have some busy weeks due to the ""move fast"" culture. Plus you have a lot of ownership which brings with it some stress.
 
The offices are crowded due to how fast we are growing. They are building a few new huge buildings but until those finish things are quite cramped, and the work place can get loud. 

Also not enough space in the gyms because of the general overcrowding on campus.","As we grow bigger, invest in making sure execution pace is still fast and we don't get bogged down in bureaucracy like other tech giants.

1) The company embodies ""move fast"". If you can prove you can create a vision and build momentum for a product and a team, you will be given the reins to move as fast as you can at FB. I've taken a project from 0 to 1 to launch in 4 countries in 4 months.

2) The company embodies ""be bold"". There are no ""small swings"" around here. There might be a lot of incremental work, optimization and tweaking on all fronts but when the company realizes progress needs to be done in an area, it's no holds barred. The big bet I'm currently leading has lead to 2 teams merging and org structures adapting to enable that shift.

3) The company embodies ""be open"" - There is a transparency to the decision making, be it at team level or at management and leadership level I've never encountered before. It's refreshing to be able to ask any question I want to Mark every Friday during the Q&A for instance.","One thing has underwhelmed me and that is that management isn't as available as I wish it would be.

Company culture is so, so good. I've had two great managers who both have done an excellent job supporting my growth and guiding my career.

It also feels like senior and C-level management really cares about employees. It feels like Facebook the company really tries to support me as a whole person (but be sure to ask for what you need! nobody's a mind reader).

For eng, bootcamp and team selection are such a good idea. I freaking love my team, and I get to own my decision to join that team (rather than some hiring/allocation manager deciding where I get to go).

Very few operational rules/bureaucracy. I can ssh into any machine I need to. If someone's fighting a fire anywhere in the company and I am able to help, I feel like I can always jump in to help. I really like Infra, so being at a big company like FB is super fun.","Oncalls can kill your sleep during your oncall shift if things are noisy overnight

It goes without saying that this company takes GREAT care of its employees, and then some. The work is challenging and super intense, but the positive and collaborative cultre, along with all of the perks/benefits offered, make the intensity much easier to deal with as opposed to any other company I've worked for.

I've been at FB for a bit over four months, but I knew during my interviews (btw these were the hardest interviews I've ever had) that this was the place to be. From application to job offer, it took 6 weeks. When I got the offer, it was so strong that there as no need to negotiate. When I got the job and relocated from NY to CA, the relocation package was was so good I didn't have to raise a finger or spend a dime. Already knew at that point that this company knows how to retain talent.

This place truly rewards merit, courage, and being outspoken. Management is aware enough (at least in my space) to place me in a role that plays to my strengths, and I've enjoyed th freedom to make my role what I want to be. They are very outspoken when you're performing well and are honest about things that need improvement. If you have a good idea that is supported by data and aligns well with the goals of your team or whatever your target population may be, you will find resources or people to join you in your efforts. From hackathons to day-to-day work, this culture permeates every area of the company. 

One thing that strikes me the most is how strong the diverse community (however small) is within this company. There are a lot of resources put towards ERG/FBRG efforts, and as a diverse employee, this means A LOT to me. 

I know the norm is to move around the industry every five years or so, but I don't see myself leaving this company for a long time. In just four months, I feel deeply rooted here, and I intend be here for a while. If you're reading this, there should be no question about applying, interviewing, or accepting an offer. You'll be happy that you made the decision.","This may be limited to my team or my area of the company, but I believe there is an underlying ""me, me, me"" culture at FB. There is a constant need to make your work visible so that others know what you're doing and so that whoever has a similar idea doesn't take the shine before you do. 

Separately, everyone wants to do knock-out work, and at times are secretive about the things that they're working on so that they can have that ""holy crap"" moment when they finally finish and reveal the results of their work. This can result in wasted resources and time since multiple people/small groups coule be working on the same thing without knowing it. Not sure what the solution is, but this at times takes away from collaborative work. I identify it as a con, but I've quickly found myself doing the same thing, and that's just because it's an underlying, unspoken culture at the company.",More work needs to be done re: PSCs. There has recently been a statement made about how PSC should not only focus on short term work but also reward long-term work. I would like to see that implemented and encouraged at a granular level. Managers should be trained to encourage long-term projects and reward employees when ambitious checkpoints are hit.

- The company is innovating and revenue growth is phenomenal. Which means the equity value grows significantly YoY. 

- Comp is good here. Facebook generally overpays a lot of recruiters compared to Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. This could be attributed to desperation because of how difficult it's been to hire recruiters.","- The bar has significantly dropped in recruiting. Because of the hyper growth Facebook is going through they've been forced to hire inexperienced recruiters and also rejects who weren't able to hack it in other top tech companies & start-ups. It used to mean a lot to be a full time recruiter at Facebook. Now it feels like they're giving an offer to anyone with a pulse. Inexperienced recruiters or bad ones can attribute to poor candidate experience and headaches for other recruiters. 

- Performance Reviews many times aren't a true reflection of individual performance. It's a problem that many companies have and Facebook is one of them. 

- The company has become so corporate. It's like you're just another number and the impact you're making is insignificant. 

- Work Life Balance is terrible. In order to be successful here you'll need to work well over 50 hours per week.","- Don't play favorites so much. Reward based on merit not who you like the most. 

- Stop hiring so many bad recruiters!!!"

It goes to great lengths to remove everyday hassles from your life so you can spend more time doing the things you love outside of work and when life happens (babies, relocation, bereavement) it's most amazing perk shines through. The people around you come together to support you and give you the time you deserve to move through life changes.

To be frank, I didn't have high expectations going in that it would be very different from the misogynistic cultures I've had to navigate at previous companies. 

Before working at Facebook, I'd kind of come to accept that being a female engineer would always be a somewhat isolating existence and the best I could do would be to find a team with 90% great colleagues and just try and avoid the creepy and rude ones as much as possible. I'd seen that as long as they performed well (or held some other utilitarian value for the company) they would always have a place in a company and their treatment of women would be an open secret and accepted.

Honestly, my first couple months at Facebook made me aware of how much effort I'd been spending navigating those types of situations.

It's incredible working with people who assume your competence rather than constantly having to battle to prove yourself.

It's amazing seeing constant efforts towards dissecting internalized biases and senior male employees openly discussing their efforts to catch themselves unconsciously interrupting people. It's laughable to try to imagine this happening at my previous companies.

They study everything and then to the best thing - if you don't like data, don't come here! All voices are equal & everyone is encouraged to participate in the conversation. In fact, if you don't - that is bad. But be prepared to back up what you say. And know you will get direct feedback on how you can get better, because we all can. Feedback is real and designed to help you get better, not judge you. Overall, an amazing place that moves fast towards a clear mission that everyone in the company is behind. Leadership is open & very strong.","I can't think of any right now. It can be a long commute for some. And it is growing really fast, so construction of new buildings can be loud.",Keep doing what you are doing!
Meta,5.0,1,more than 1 year,All good here.,2017-05-10,Software Engineer,"Seattle, WA",2,2,2,- In FB you work hard but FB also works hard to make you happy.,- Engineering processes can be chaotic due to the rapid growth of the company.,
Meta,4.0,0,more than 3 years,Great Place to Work but,2017-05-08,Business Operations,"Menlo Park, CA",2,2,2,"- At it's best working at Facebook is fast paced, fun and extremely impactful. I've been given opportunities to work with many great colleagues who care deeply about the work that you're doing and will challenge and encourage you to do better. 
- Support staff at Facebook is amazing whether it be the people who greet you in the morning, facilities, IT, the security guards, chefs, or the the people who work at the gym. Everyone is super friendly and has your best interest at heart. It's like going to work at a 5 Star Hotel every single day :)
- Feedback is taken very seriously and typically acted upon. For example a couple of years ago Facebook didn't offer 4 months paternity leave for employees outside of the US and after receiving feedback from international employees this was policy was expanded globally
- Perks are amazing, free food, gym (or membership for offices without gyms), laundry, great healthcare.","- Mid-level managers are a hit or miss. I've had 4 different managers in 3 years at Facebook and my experience at work has greatly been dependent on how competent they are. My best manager pushed me and opened doors and was a true advocate for me within the company, whereas my worst manager who was also a first time manager made me feel as if I was working on an island. If you're joining Facebook in a non-tech role you should definitely try your best to get a feel for your future manager.
- As the company has hired over 10K+ people over the past 3 years roles and responsibilities are definitely becoming more specialized and opportunities to drive tangible impact are becoming increasingly difficult for people in junior roles
- Pay and benefits for people working in international offices are not comparable to working at HQ. For example IVF is offered in the US but not non-US offices.","As Facebook grows and continues to invest in hiring, finding people with prior management experience will be key to retaining and developing talent."
Meta,5.0,1,more than 1 year,Awesome Company/ Great Employees,2017-04-25,Anonymous Employee,"Seattle, WA",2,2,2,"Aside from the countless perks that are literally too long to list out here, one of the best things about this company is it's people. Everyone goes above and beyond to help each other to succeed. It truly is a team effort. 

Upon arriving to the office every morning, everyone from the reception staff to your team says hello to you, and genuinely is interested in your life. People love coming to work every morning and are excited about what they do here every day, and it shows. 

Many companies as competitive as this expect a lot from their employees, and so does Facebook. However, they also encourage a healthy work/ life balance, ensuring their employees are taking enough time off (either by working reasonable hours every day, and/or actually using all of their PTO) to be able to stay fresh and ready to work when at work.","Not many cons to the company. It is a large company, so I guess the biggest con would be you are not going to know everyone at the company. But with how friendly people are, you will make friends in no time!",Keep up the awesome transparency! It goes a long way with the employees.

Meta,5.0,1,more than 3 years,I found my people,2017-04-16,Production Engineer,"Boston, MA",2,2,2,"I really feel as though I've found my people.

I've had this dissonance in past roles: ever since academia years ago, I've been out of the ""research"" phase and into the ""engineer at a X company"" stage, where ""X"" is occasionally a software product but more often a service or commercial product. The culture was not one of making the right things, but making the profitable thing now. Driven by sales people, there was a lot of grandstanding, peacocking, both in the culture and in the message.

Facebook has my people, my culture. We do things in the way that scales and makes engineering sense. Sure, perfect is the enemy of good enough, but if a temporary shortcut remediates a problem or a need, it's quickly iterated to improve, all the while immersed in a tech culture: Pusheen, Archer, Dr Who, Starwars, memes, the micro-actions that continually reinforce a culture-fit or a culture-miss.

I'm in the culture fit. Sure, I get a very competitive salary, plus my tech chops improve (when C++ gurus review your work, your C++ quality improves), and the food, and the perks, but above all, this is the place I feel I most fit.

I'm in my mid-40s. I ""get schooled"" my mid-20s. ...and it's awesome.","Pace is a killer. The work is complex, as are the discussions about it, I have little fuel in my head to code after work. Big personal desire to keep up to the more efficient engineers. I don't want to pass-a-fault, but want to move-fast, get all the things done. It's exhausting!","Open a highschool.

We have hired so many of the good people, the recruiting funnel is sparse. We need to grow our engineers. Open a high school to get right-of-first-refusal :)"

If I were to pick one pro out of all of them - it's the people. Whatever you heard or read about Facebook really doesn't give the place enough credit. I'm not in HR/recruiting or even management, but I do see a common trend in everyone they bring on board. Everyone is smart, motivated, non-judgemental, and freakishly CARING. There are so many people with heart at FB.

To be honest, you can be one heck of a coder, but if you're selfish - I don't think you will get hired here. I've previously worked at Google and MSFT; FB blows both of them out of the water (maybe I'm a little biased). Other pro's of course are... 

+ Free world class food options all day long on the main campus cafeteria (MPK 20/21).This includes great snacks/drink options everywhere else as well. 
+ Fantastic PPO/HMO health care options. The premiums are very reasonable.

- Great workplace environment. Coworkers feel like family and are very supportive of each other. 
- Mission of the company truly runs deep. 
- Flexible work hours and environment. There is generally a high degree of trust between employees.","- The open floor plan can be completely draining (especially for introverts, like myself). 
- Very unclear career growth. I started as an early career employee and one of the main reasons I left was because I felt like there was really little investment in my professional and personal growth. I found that Facebook really likes employees that will work hard and make them look good, but they don't care about helping you move up to the next level. There was no clear progression. A part of this is the flat organizational structure, which appeals to some but not to all. 
- Very millennial feeling (I'm a millennial too) and can feel extremely unprofessional at times. No line between personal and professional relationships. Again, this is up to personal choice but it didn't feel great to me all the time. 
- Cult-like worship of upper management (Mark and Sheryl). They are awesome people to look up to but people are not critical enough of the company all the time. It felt like people were always blind-sided by the flashiness of M-team's messaging. 
- Facebook hires a lot of contractors to full-time positions (especially in Austin), which can feel irksome. 
- Since the company has grown so much, they need to stop acting like a startup. 
- It's easy to do work that isn't actually fulfilling but is necessary to run the company. 
- Loved the mission and messaging of the company but didn't feel like my work was impactful in any way, which was an unfortunate feeling. 
- Pay is not that good for entry level/early career business side roles. Engineers make a lot more, unsurprisingly. 
- This is an engineer-run company, after all. So if you are on the business side, expect to be heavily reliant on engineering resources, which can be extremely draining and frustrating. 
- Facebook says it's easy to transition between roles and teams but I found that to not be true. That's another reason why I left. It may be easier on the engineering side. Additionally, being a remote office truly limits your networking and career opportunities (even if they tell you otherwise). 
- I had more managers than I could count in one year. The turnover was way too high and I didn't feel like anyone was invested in me. I wasn't growing and as an early career professional, growth is my top priority.
- Facebook is a global company and most of its users are outside of the US. However, the mindset is still extremely American and I frankly found the way in which people talked about users outside of the US to be downright offensive at times. There was no desire to get to deeply understand user behavior and market trends outside of the US. Given how the world economy is trending, Facebook will be in a bad position if employee mindsets don't change. There are companies all over the world (especially in Asia) that are taking over (and have already taken over) the spaces Facebook is trying to break into as of late.
- A combination of unclear expectations and high manager turnover led to not-stellar performance reviews for me. 
- People always said I could work on what interested me and what I was good at but whenever I tried to do so, I was shut down.",

Meta,3.0,0,more than 3 years,"Facebook is the worst job, except for all the others",2016-11-30,Infrastructure Engineer,"Menlo Park, CA",-1,2,1,"Facebook is probably the best big company to work for. The company cares a lot about having its employees being productive and satisfied with their jobs and it works hard at maintaining an environment to support that. As a survivor from the real world, this is really rare -- pretty much every company-wide system is designed to make life easier for employees. The benefits and conveniences offered are amazing.

Many decisions about the company and its goals are made fairly transparently and open discussion about most things is encouraged. This can get really annoying at times.

Unlike most companies, Zuck is actually a pretty inspiring leader. He makes mistakes, but does learn from them. He has really lofty goals, though, and doing the right thing is highly subjective when trying to change the world.

If you are politically savvy and willing to work hard and make sure others notice that hard work, you will go far. You will learn a lot if you seek out opportunities to learn, and work with a lot of very talented people. You have to own this yourself, though; don't count on a lot of support.","Facebook still believes that it is a magical meritocracy reasonably free from corporate nonsense. While there aren't any Office Space-style TPS reports to fill out and you don't have to bring in your own coffee and toilet paper, it is now just a big company job like any other. If you want something, whether it be a promotion or a good dessert from the cafeteria, you have to plan how to get it, execute on the plan, and then make sure everyone else knows what you did and how great it was. You also have to share just enough detail to be convincing but not so much that people can poke holes in your story or usurp your dessert acquisition techniques.

The typical first level line manager at Facebook doesn't have prior management experience, only knows the Facebook way of doing things, and is overwhelmed with all the pressure being placed on them. It's a really hard job, too; your manager will be responsible both for setting the direction of your team and for making sure you and your colleagues grow at the company. Most people are not good at either of those things, let alone both. Be aware of what your manager is looking for and how to best communicate it.

Everything FB does is subject to a lot of public scrutiny, and you will know how the sausage is made and see that the goals of the company aren't focused on invading privacy or global domination like everyone else thinks. It's hard to see this thing that takes up so much of your life lionized and loathed by the press and your friends.

For engineers, a lot of the tools you will use day-to-day are incomplete, broken, poorly documented, and might not be supported anymore. You will get used to this. ""Move fast and break things"" is more complicated than it sounds, and that's really hard to adapt to when coming from a more traditional company. Have big goals but chop them up into small tasks with well-defined success indicators and communicate them early and often.","To the director- and VP-level people that have been at FB a long time: it's not the same company you went to work at lo those many years ago. There are between 5 and 50 times more employees now, way more products, and way more moving parts. If you want Facebook to stay Facebook-y, invest in the culture that you love. Teach people how to be successful and reward individuals that focus on impact that makes everyone's work easier and the product better, not on whatever new hotness made a contrived graph go in the right direction. Lots of things aren't working right anymore and it is up to you to start the hard conversations about which sacred cows can't provide enough milk for tens of thousands of employees because you never taught the new people how to talk about that stuff."

I was told the Product Support role would be a precursor to Product Management and that you will be spending a lot of time strategizing and helping product teams with their product roadmaps. A couple weeks in, and I soon realized that this role is purely operational and SLA based. We manned bug reports on a daily basis. Everything was numbers driven, but not in the right way. We were encouraged to analyze the tickets to find ways to improve SLA. 

Leadership is quite weak. They only listen to our goals and aspirations but neither help us or nor point us to the right direction. Most of the team don't plan to stay for long. Everyone seems to have a plan B or to be using this role as a springboard to another one within Facebook.

Although I hear great things from other teams, this one is not it.","When hiring for new recruits, don't sell them on what the team will be in 2 years. Let them know what is the current state of the team. Be honest about how much time is spent on day-to-day ""tasks""

Try to be a leader and not numbers driven for your own career benefits.

Facebook is an open company, uphold those cultures."

Meta,5.0,1,less than 1 year,Landslide win over Google for career growth,2015-05-01,Software Engineer,"Menlo Park, CA",2,2,2,"I just left Google and joined Facebook, and felt so much happier. The reasons are:

1. The real impact
At Google I joined a team whose product is only used by less than 1000 people, and even for that product I was assigned to do a peripheral part, whose functionality actually doesn't matter at all. Just for that module, I had to write unit test for every silly part of the code, and took long iteration cycles. I admit those are good engineering coding trainings, however taking precious time in my life to work on something that doesn't matter is just a waste of my life.

In Facebook things just move so much faster. There are standard software engineering review process but not as rigid. Just during training (boot camp) weeks, I had tasks to change very important part of Facebook's core code, and the second day after I check-in my code, it got shipped to almost 1 billion people. As a software engineer I cannot recall a moment I felt better for my job.

Then I joined a team that's extremely important to Facebook's revenue. A mistake in the code I changed could cause Facebook million dollar a day. However Facebook just trusted us, allowed us making mistake and having quick iteration cycles to test ideas fast. If I make a coding mistake in my team in Google it might cost Google nothing in terms of revenue as my product was small, however the development process was so strict I could not have chance to try my innovations or test my ideas. But in Facebook that's all possible.

2. The organizational structure
Google's organization is now very structured and hierarchical. Facebook is having more layers, but the working style is still flat, and social-network style. Speaking to people in different teams, form an idea, lead a virtual team and complete it, this style is still valued. My boss is more like a mentor helping me navigating through the ideas, rather than an authority telling me what to do.","1. I don't quite like the office decoration style. A little bit stressful and factory like.
2. The compensation is better than Google but not as good as other smaller companies.
3. Despite good acquisitions for solidify the position in social media, social networks, there is still uncertainty about the future of this company.",

I no longer have any confidence that the leadership knows what they are doing. Rather than helping their people identify and align on impactful projects, they are turned inwards, patting themselves on the back from the top down and only caring about posturing in their own careers. It's politics in the worst way, and can go unchecked at a company as large as Facebook. They systemically suppress the talents of people who do not buy into the secret club.

Meta,5.0,1,less than 1 year,What a great place to work,2016-10-18,Engineering Manager,"Boston, MA",2,2,2,"There are many, but here are a few of my favorites:

- Play to your strengths. Too many companies and too many people work on improving weaknesses, in hopes of becoming well-rounded. This is fine, but often the better strategy is to play to your strengths, where employees do more of what they're good at, and less of what they're not good at, in a diverse team. I've never seen this done as well as at Facebook.

- Moving fast at scale. There are so many tools and frameworks to help you still move fast, as fast as any startup, that's it awesome. So impressive at Facebook's scale.

- World-class team. I know this is said often and loses meaning, but it's true here. Every single person is both smart and nice, a rare combination.

- They care about the right things, and don't care about the wrong things. Both parts of this are important. Too many companies sweat the small stuff that doesn't matter, e.g. who's invited to a meeting or whatever. At Facebook, everyone is just trying to make a positive impact, without care for politics etc.","- Things change fast. If you're not at ease with change, or if you're seeking a place that never changes, this is not the right company for you. This includes projects, tools, technologies, teams...

- There are multiple technical ways of doing most things. It's not always clear which is the best way, so you have to ask people. I think that's actually OK as you get to know your colleagues. But if you're the kind of person who wants perfect documentation for everything, this is not the place for you.","Stick to what you're doing, it's working :)"

Facebook, the company, is amazing. What the company is doing to connect the world is something that is truly astonishing and amazing. Being able to work for an employer that is changing the world before our eyes is something not many people will ever get the chance to say they were a part of!","The culture of some of the departments is slipping away faster than most people would like to admit. The company is becoming more and more ""corporate"" with more politics settling in. This ranges from managers hiring friends and old colleagues, completely bypassing our interview process, to putting ""policies"" in place against company culture that puts unnecessary roadblocks in place, slowing down productivity. The company is growing, which can be appreciated, but the amount of emphasis that is being put on us that we need to move to being ""more corporate"" is completely against what the company was built on.",TRUST your employees. A little bit of trust goes a long way. This isn't the government or a large corporation - this is Facebook - a once choice employer who is getting eroded by managers doing their best to build an empire and put as many layers of insulation between them and their lowest ranking employees.

We also launch to hundreds-of-millions-to-billions of users, depending on the product, making our contributions very high-value. Product launches continue to be driven by bottom-up ideas as much as top-down directives. That doesn't mean that you personally are going to have an idea which shakes the world, but it does mean that you have a better shot than other companies.
Especially if you're an infrastructure engineer, the culture is very bottom-up. You still have great latitude to come up with execute your own ideas. The flipside of this coin is that if you're not good at deciding what to work on, you'll need to learn that skill within a year or so; management isn't going to spoonfeed you tasks to the extent they do at other large companies.
When joining Facebook as an engineer, you will still have many many choices of which team to join, and you'll make that decision after a few weeks of ""bootcamp"" which means you'll have an informed choice. It also means that the quality of engineers is high throughout the company because every person comes through the same interviewing process.
One of my favorite aspects of Facebook culture is focusing on impact rather than hard work. Another is a recognition that you can advance your career without going into management, and that there are many different kinds of talent. There are several different ""archetypes"" of senior individual contributors that are recognized and encouraged to flourish.","Facebook has become more careful in certain core areas like Newsfeed, Timeline, Ads, and Platform. There are many stakeholders on these products and thus you've got to get a lot more things buttoned up before you can launch a product change in these core areas. We still do experiments but not quite as freely as before. Just understand that the more impact your product has, the tougher it will be to make changes, and place yourself in the company according to your preferences.",

I know that this is a competitive industry but sometimes the stupid people win just because they have the right connection. Bad employees stay while realistic workers realize the mistreatment and all leave within a year. I'm not making this up. Go look up Facebook's overall turnover ratio and tell me how that could lead to happy employees. Every SINGLE person on my initial project was lied to about their working hours (expect 9-5 and told 9-5 then made work overnight/graveyard shifts), benefits (only get to go on campus when with a supervisor), and team management.

You get to work with a visionary leadership team that is incredibly accessible and wants to hear from you. Mark's Townhall meetings grew out of the weekly Q&A that he runs internally. If you want to ask Mark Zuckerburg or Sheryl Sandberg a question you can do it. If you want to give feedback or see changes in nearly any aspect of Facebook you will be empowered to do it.

Your team will likely be comprised of industry experts in your particular area of work. From kernel hackers, PhD's in computer learning, hardware engineers building drones and our own servers, to network engineers that are helping write drafts and RFC's that define the underlying protocol architecture of the Internet - you will find everything under the sun and these people will make you so much better at what you do.

If you aren't enjoying what you're doing in your current role you can go on a Hack-a-month with another team. This lets you expand your skills working on a different set of challenges and stay on your new team when you finish, if you like the work, or head back to your old team to work on something else. The best part is that management encourages these types of moves!

The management teams empower you to work on the things you want to, and gives you the ability to impact billions of people. You work on one of the biggest platforms on the planet and you will see the results of the work you put in everyday in making it better.

Also, the benefits are pretty amazing.","Any complaints seem like extreme first world gripes given all that the company does to keep the employees happy and progressing in their positions and careers, but I do have a few.

The company will absolutely (and gladly) take as much time as you put in. They don't overly pressure you to work insane hours, but you will be surrounded by overachievers who put that pressure on themselves and create the perception that large swaths of the company are, ""always working."" This can be a blessing or curse and it is up to each individual employee to figure out the dreaded work / life balance equation for themselves.

The other issue, is that Facebook prides itself on not competing on salary, RSU's, etc. against offers from other companies. While that may seem ok in practice, it results in a revolving door (which is a bit of a Silicon Valley issue in and of itself) between other big tech companies and Facebook.

Meta,5.0,1,more than 1 year,A dream company come true!,2015-12-09,Product Designer,"Menlo Park, CA",2,2,2,"On my first day at Facebook, I remember asking myself, ""Is this company for real? How am I here? How does this company exist?"" Facebook is the epitome of the perfect company. A wise man once told me about the four Ps of the perfect employment: Product, Problem, People, Profit. 

Is the Product interesting? This product serves over 1.5 billion people - it is the most exciting product to be part of.

Is the Problem interesting? Beyond interesting. We're trying to solve making the entire world more open and connected through communication, through sharing, through education, etc... In any area of the company, the problems are all great problems to solve.

What about the People? The people are literally the best people I've ever worked with in any position I've been through. They are brilliant, kind, friendly and completely supportive. I left my last company as a senior member and at Facebook, I still feel like I'm learning something new from my colleagues every single day. Beyond my colleagues, the leadership here are more than supportive about an individual's career growth to help us grow deep within our roles, support groups to help you become a better manager, classes to help individuals transition from one career to another. I've seen many of my colleagues get the opportunity to completely change paths (e.g. Designer to Engineer, Researcher to Designer, Designer to PM, etc). You pave your own path and leadership here is supportive to help you get to where you want to be.

So what about Profit? Facebook, luckily, is doing very well in this area. At a personal level, Facebook pays also very well. I was lucky enough to have my total acquisition package matched and exceeded which made saying yes to Facebook a no brainer.

Take a great product, great people, amazing culture and a beautiful place to work and tie that all up in a bow. That is what Facebook is and I hope it never changes.

- Facebook holds one of the best standards on its benefits - better than all companies with equivalent size.
- People working here are just happier than average industry level, due to this reason you would feel happier too.
- Company momentum is just great, so this could be potentially a place you can stay for a while.
- Great engineers just come from all other companies, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon. College new hires come from top ones: Stanford/MIT/CIT and things.
- Good amount of people here are both smart and diligent, you have many to learn from.
- Although coworkers are competitive here, they are much nicer to work with than other companies holding same 'elite principals'. For example, I rarely see (though there're few) arrogant people here. The whole culture was built in the sense to favor people who are both smart and humble.
- Culture encourages transparency, so you have to learn hear and accept sometimes very tough feedbacks, but you could end up growing much faster as you can tell.
- If you are good, there's no barrier on 'what you can do'. Facebook does NOT reveal your level to anyone else except your report. So you could see E3 engineers work like E4 or even E5 in the end. But in another way around, it could be tough for seniors.
- Facebook sees deliveries (executions) as 1st priority, so people here just focus on work more than the rest, I believe this is one of the biggest reasons why this company moves faster than other companies with equivalent size.
- Most of work in Facebook reaches great amount of people (1.5B in web, 1.3B in mobile), and great amount of revenue (20B of this year). So you can tell how much impact you can have, and this would to the minimum becomes a highlighting bullet point on your resume.
- People says Facebook has bad work/life balance, I don't agree: 1) you have freedom to pick a laid-back team and free to go almost anytime (they have hackamonth program and it is true), 2) most of time I see hardworking people working hard due to their own choice.","- People says Facebook has less politics, but I do feel some.

- Low tolerance of BS, low tolerance of ""everything is amazing, everyone is perfect"" when things can be improved. 
- The org moves fast with people issues, low performance (when appropriate), and childish behavior (very very low tolerance for this). 
- Incredibly lean orgs, especially in HR, so you really have the ability to own a business from end to end. 
- Low tolerance for politics or front stage/back stage behavior. 
- Best HR team I've ever worked with including the best manager I've ever worked with. Full of high performing, no jerk, high wit peers at the top of their game.","- Incredibly lean - At least on the non-tech side of the house we could easily add 5 more HRBP's/HRG's and still be understaffed.

- there seems to be a group of the before and afters- who struggle to understand the company has grown and will not go back to the first 100 employees! This leads to a sense of entitlement and not playing as a team.
- commute. UGH
-Need to do better with giving back (as a company and as employees). I know our CEO has donated gazillions- but we need programs that allow employees to donate and have funds matched, and allow employees to volunteer their time.

The people at this company genuinely believe they're changing the world by connecting it, and that mission and set of values permeate everything they do. 

-Unbelievable benefits and compensation. Seriously, some of their benefits are mind-blowing. Gym benefits, free (really good) food everywhere, amazing healthcare and family planning and daycare benefits (including a ""baby bonus""), access to incredible company events and speakers, generous vacation time that they're constantly encouraging you to actually use, the latest phones and computers for work use, on-site doctor and dentist that are actually good...the list goes on and on. 
- Strong company culture and values. I've never been at a company that lives and breathes a mission so completely. Am constantly in meetings where coworkers are asking, ""Is this the right decision for the people who use Facebook?"". Even the way they treat their contingent workers (who receive better benefits than most of the tech sector's contingent employees do) makes this evident; there are internal communication groups where full-time employees are constantly asking what more we could be doing for contingent workers to show our appreciation for their work. Both internally and externally, the ""#shiplove"" mantra is strong here.
-Work/life balance. You'll see some mixed reviews on this point, but I've been here a year (non-engineering role) and I've never had the level of work/life balance I've had here. I work a very consistent 9-5, and it's rare when I have to fire up my laptop at home at night or over the weekends.
-Facilities. It's Facebook! The campus is gorgeous, and they allow visitors. Hosting out-of-town friends and family for lunch or dinner is a great perk.
-Efficient and fast. Fewer politics than many other companies of this size. A lot of the day-to-day communication and work gets done on the Facebook platform, which is hugely efficient and easy to use system.
-The future! These guys have their hands in a lot of cookie jars, and are working on some really amazing stuff. Whether you're working on things like bringing internet access to the third world, virtual reality products, artificial intelligence that will serve peoples' needs, or all of the innovative things that go on inside the regular ol' Facebook app that serves over a billion people a day, chances are you're working on something really cool.
-Women's leadership. I've also never been at a company that really understands women's needs as much as Facebook does (I think we owe this to the leadership of Sheryl Sandberg, Lori Goler and Maxine Williams). They encourage an ongoing dialogue about women's issues in the workplace, have mothers' rooms all around campus, encourage us all to take a ""Managing Bias"" course (which is really eye-opening, on many levels) and even host a yearly Women's Leadership Day, which is truly empowering. They bring in amazing speakers for this event and out of everything I've experienced in my first year here, this was probably the event that stayed with me the most.","-Entitlement. After you've worked here for a while, it's easy to get entitled. I'd say 95% of employees keep their feet on the ground and appreciative and gracious about the benefits they receive, but the entitlement plus the company's culture of open feedback (""feedback is a gift"") occasionally breeds inane complaints in internal communication groups.
-That commute. If you live in SF, you'll have to hike down to Menlo Park, and depending upon where you're coming from and how bad traffic is that day, it could be as bad as 2 hours each day. The good news: that's rare, and company-provided transportation options (shuttles with WiFi) make this as easy as possible. You do get used to it, and your time on the shuttle is your own. Sure, you can do work, but you can also nap, watch Netflix, or read.","As you grow, you'll be tempted to cut back spending on benefits-- don't.

They indicated that no contractors could ever offer value; contractors were viewed as an extra pair of hands. However, my role was specifically to provide expertise and coaching in my domain area. The junior/mid-level staff never solicited feedback and assumed only their ideas were useful. Just because people say they are open to feedback does not make it so. I got unsolicited feedback constantly at FB: everyone has an opinion and thinks it's valuable. But, not once did anyone ever ask for my feedback. In that sense, and many others, it's a hypocritical environment. 

If you're junior or less than 15 years in your job, FB is probably a good place to grow. If you're more experienced, be sure you carefully evaluate the job. My experience is that I wasn't working with the best or brightest, more often they were the narrow-minded, arrogant and entitled.

Finally, in the area I worked, it was all about blame and pointing fingers when things went wrong. And because they hate processes, of course things would go wrong.","Puleeeze - do you really think management is listening?

The CEO meets with all employees once a week and answers anyone's questions.

Most people here are energetic and passionate about their work and seriously focused on making an impact. The work environment is physically (and culturally) very open: open spaces, no offices, casual dress, etc. Work/life balance is respected and encouraged and you have the flexibility to work in the way that best matches your individual style and needs.

Anyone can suggest a new feature or improvement and be part of the team that makes it happen. There is a lot of opportunity for high performers to grow their careers. The compensation, benefits and perks are truly above par. 

One of the most important things for me is the open culture and the way Facebook encourages employees to find and be our authentic selves, and to listen to the voices of others who may be different from ourselves.

The company is getting bigger. This means more room for backroom politics and aligning people without ruffling people's feathers.

Very talented individual contributors (and/or good at politics) are being promoted. As a result, instead of having well rounded managers, you end up having either extremely career driven or super awkward managers. Some of those middle managers are very green, making it even more painful.

Most companies have a mission; some say they follow it, and extremely few are actually mission led. Facebook truly believes in making the world more open and connected; including those people who aren't even online yet. Every role and department ladders back to that. 

In advertising sales, we have the goal of building our client's businesses by connecting them to the consumers who matter to them. More importantly, we ensure that people on Facebook are seeing ads that are relevant and high quality, this delivers shared value both for the advertiser and the end person using our products. We also have proven and measurable results across verticals, which drives continued client interest and adoption. 

Having come from another founder led company, Mark is incredibly brilliant, open, honest and hard working. He surrounds himself with fantastic people, listens carefully, cares about the people who work for him, and makes long view decisions for the health of the company. 

Management and the people who work at Facebook follow leadership's example, everyone rolls up their sleeves to get the work done, and is incredibly grateful to be here. 

As a woman it's also inspiring and impactful to have female leadership at all levels, and colleagues who are incredibly encouraging. I personally experienced this when a male peer encouraged me to apply for a management position on our team. He referenced the known bias that women are less likely to apply if they don't have 100% of qualifications vs. men who take it as a suggestion. Beyond gender, the entire company strives for diversity and acceptance.","You have to be very self driven to succeed. Seeking out and maintaining internal relationships is critical for success.

Projects: Every team is understaffed, so there is a ton of incredibly important work to do everywhere. Because of this, you can work on high-impact (and potentially high-visibilty) projects from Day 1.

Autonomy: I've always felt extremely trusted in both my technical competency and prioritization skills. Management is (generally) helpful when I want help, but mostly I've been able to do my own thing and work on whatever project feels most important to the company and/or interesting to me.

People: Everyone is really smart, and most people are really friendly, funny, and generally awesome to hang out with.

Food: Amazing. Healthy options are phenomenal, as are the unhealthy ones.

Gym: The staff is incredible.

So much more!","- Stress: The company likes to run slim. As mentioned in the pros above, this means you're always working on impactful projects, but it also means your team is understaffed and you may have to work some nights and weekends to get stuff done (though definitely not as bad as the previous strartup I worked for). The more teams you work with, the worse this can get, since some people love to load up on meetings during the day.

Egos: There are some people who are really full of themselves and difficult to work with. This happens anywhere I've been, but there's a special brand of self-importance among some folks here. Fortunately, I've never had to work too closely with these people, but they make their presence known.","Zuck: Keep doing what you're doing. You articulate a great vision for the company and always seem very ""real"" at Q&As.

Lower management: Live true to the company goals. Unblock your reports, play to their strengths, and help them grow. Instead of requesting ""more leadership"" from ICs, say what that means and provide coaching."
Meta,4.0,0,,Team Lead,2015-04-10,Team Lead,"Menlo Park, CA",-1,2,1,Smart people. Cutting edge technologies. Amazing food.,"Some huge, out-of-control egos in management, especially at the middle layers. Couple that with the general immaturity of the company and you'll see some very poor judgement and ""Game of Thrones"" style politics in a few departments. 

Average tenure of a staff engineer is about 4 years - mostly because after the initial stock grants vest there is near zero incentive for anyone under a Director level to stay any longer.

Culture creates and fosters entitled whiners - so much so that it is a running joke inside the company, with groups such as ""Patently Absurd Requests for Facebook Offices"" making fun of it all. But then again, this company is largely made up of the ""participation trophy"" generation, who have been told they were super-special since they were born. Being hired by Facebook amplifies that self-esteem level well beyond eleven. 

It is never spoken about, but staff turnover is huge. The washout rate of n00bs is likely around 40%. Truly talented staff move around, so team continuity is rare. 

Zero work-life balance - unless you happen to have a kid while working there.","Fix the broken review and calibration cycle, especially the schedule and unspoken stack ranking. Strive for higher competence levels in departments outside of Engineering - starting with HR.

The work-life-balance issue goes beyond the mere hours: it is expected that you become FB friends with all your coworkers, managers, etc. FB makes it impossible for the realm of your private life to remain separate from your workplace and coworkers.

Great benefits (salary, shares, medical, 401k,...)","Bad work / life balance - you better be jusr out of college with no wife/husband/partner; nor any children.
They do not know how to deal with senior people. Managers are just employees who do more work; they do not have time or the need to help out. I have seen a few people get thrown under the bus by the boss - why defend your team when Menlo Parks complains because they do not know what you are doing; fix another task and get new employees.","Get real managers. I have seen many people from your Seattle office leave or ""get helped"" to leave - they were not bad employees and you paid a lot to acquire them - you have a revolving door because you have junior managers - at best - running the office; and they report to even less trained managers in Menlo Park. You are making tons of money right now and it probably won't show up for quite some time, but, at one point, poor people management will cause pains to Facebook - in 5 years you will be like Google and in 10 you will be like Microsoft.

A lot is given to the employees so the company expects a lot in return.
Working-life balance can be challenging depending on your Manager and where your Team is based (US, Europe and/or Asia --> meeting can be quite early and/or quite late following the different time-zones). 
Performance are generally evaluated not (or not only) based on specific goals, but also based on what your colleagues from the same team on a global level have achieved compared to you (kind of benchmark performance review). So maybe your goal was X and you do X+10, but most of your teammates achieve X+30, so you can get a ""doesn't meet expectations"" on your review.

This becomes unhearthy, as work and life balance suffers, pressure increases and you end up receiving less compensation for what's essentially the same work.

Also, there's a MASSIVE disconnect between ""everything proprietary internal"" and ""the real world"", so the longer you work for the company, the more distant you are from skills and tools that'll use at your next job, as most of what was learned, is essentially lost.

And everyone is nice & collaborative possibly because the culture filters out those who are not",- In many teams you are busy 4-6pm London time because of meetings with US west coast. You need to actively manage your work life balance particularly if you need to pick up kids by 6pm. WFH helps a lot. And the company/ team respects people's boundaries.

Need to bargain hard on your CTC while joining the company to safeguard your interests. Managers have absolutely NO say in your compensation and wont be able to help you even if you perform well.
One should always interview for the Software Engineer position, which has slightly better pay, more opportunities to move around, different (better?) evaluation standards!

If you end up in a team which has no clear charter, you are expected to find your own work while the managers would not support you with this

- Good compensation (if you compare things within UK)
- Handled COVID really well.","- Onboarding is a hit & miss - you need to be very conscious about what team / manager you choose.
- Managers are a ""hit & miss"" too (this is particularly true for EMEA).
- Lots of change, often lack of continuity, lots of friction (in org, code, ownership...) due to this.
- Often short-term thinking; people are smart but incentives often set up in a way that encourages short term thinking.
- You cannot get away with simply being a great engineer; you need to be a sort of social butterfly and build personal connections as well to meet expectations. 
- Unless you are very conscious about your own growth and career, you can have a hard time growing.
- Hours can be long in order to meet expectations (WLB can be especially challenging if you need to work with US west coast).
- Peer pressure to achieve more and more and more... can lead to a vicious cycle and often burn-out. Differences in personal circumstance (and willingness/opportunity to put in extra hours) are not really taken into account when impact is measured.","- Onboarding, onboarding, onboarding: put much more emphasis on onboarding (primarily culturally) and don't let newcomers join teams where there is either only superficial incentive or no bandwidth to support ramp-up (that's a lose-lose for everyone).
- Put much more emphasis on growth of individuals (and keeping them longer).
- Incentivize managers to in fact grow the people they support (i.e. their reports), current system usually fairly judges current performance but leaves much of growth-related thinking, acting and planning to the report - unless you are lucky and get a great manager but it's pure luck.
- Encourage people to switch teams (and try out different things) at the slightest hint of interest."

The project has lost most of its key personnel because the Director for Product was unable to give a clear direction, and censored all the reasonable ideas. My manager was inexperienced and refused to hear any suggestion that I made. It felt really demoralising and frustrating. I reached out to other managers, friends from previous job who agreed that it was frustrating… but that’s it.
– I agree, this is a horrible situation.
– What can I do about it?
– I don’t know…
– Wait a year, so I can change teams?
– Maybe. That was changed to 18 months though.

All three of the Org, the project and my manager had ""the worst Pulse rating in the history of the company"" at their level, according to people who had been at Facebook longer. No one reached out.

Several key stakeholders left, notably one senior Data engineer. I offered to take over some of their workload because I knew how and I badly needed data to do my own work. That was yet another suggestion that my manager shut down.

It got tiring really fast.","Offer ICs to change manager if those have a low Pulse rating.

I have nothing but good things to say about the team, managers and upper management. 

- The team culture is very supportive, leaving room for development. Further, the team is young, talented, curious and entrepreneurial - creating a fun environment to work in. 

- I had multiple different managers within the Nordic team, all were seeking to understand my needs, supporting my development. I always felt very valued, listened to and could talk to my managers about anything. 

- You get the chance to take on high responsibility straight away, such as consulting mid-large size business in the digital marketing space. Or to take on internal projects, with real impact. 

- Great opportunity to develop yourself and your skills through; Coaching from managers, mentorship programs, training sessions, lectures etc. 

- No micro management, managers trust that you deliver good work and coach if needed. 

- Work Life Balance is great! Yes, the goals could be tough from time to time and new joiners might feel that it is a lot to learn the first few months. Your manager will encourage and enable you to not work late. Also, everyone is encouraged to go work out during office hours, (Pre-covid there were regular group sessions with Facebook to go work out if you wanted to). Also, no one expects that you sit late in the office.","- Sometimes tough to see your impact/contribution in an organization of this size and turnover. 

- Things move fast and what is your goal one day might need to change the other. 

- A bit American centralized, meaning that conversations around policies/products/incentives could lean towards solving problems that are more relevant in the US compared to the EU.

- A bit tough for junior employees in central offices (Dublin) to move internally to new positions in local offices (i.e. Stockholm, Oslo). It´s doable, but hard.",

I joined during COVID and it became clear extremely quickly how much they deeply care about their employees and their well being. Can work-life balance be challenging in a company full of top performers with high performance expectations? Absolutely! But it is really on you to manage your own time and success. There is no pressure from the organization to work after hours and using your PTO and leave options is greatly encouraged. 

I personally love the casual and open culture. When they say ""bring your whole self to work"" they mean it. Coming from a more traditional company it took a little time to adapt to this as well as to adjust to how people communicate with each other but now I'm hooked. 

The opportunities for continued learning and professional growth seem boundless. They really like to promote from within and there are so many resources for building your career based around what interests you the most.","One challenging aspect is that everyone has an option about Facebook and we are constantly on the news, but that's true of any top company.

Meta,5.0,0,less than 1 year,Amazing company,2021-03-20,Finance,"Dublin, Dublin",2,2,2,"It provides a user interface that is familiar and proven to assist in engaging people to use the platform. The layout is clean and minimal and pleasing and that helps staff become comfortable with interacting with one another.
Group insights are a fantastic feature that allows you to see how a certain topic, discussion or file is performing with the staff or audience. If you are seeking feedback on a particular memo, for instance, the insights will catalog who has viewed, how many comments, questions or interactions, etc. It helps to see in real-time, the things staff or clients are excited about and then the items where no one comments.
Cataloging of historical information is a real benefit. The dashboard has a notes section where I will keep a lot of private and or personal reflections that I can reference at a later time. I may jot a few notes about a project so I can recall them at a later point. Many programs do this, but again, this is all within the same house and for time and memory sake, this really works well.
Segmenting is very easy to do. We have set up Groups for various projects, teams, clients or cohorts. You can segment as much as you want and one person may be in more than one group but maybe not all groups. Basic segmenting that works well. Notifications are sent when new posts or news is released.
The platform is not the same portal as Facebook so there is no chance that posts get put on the wrong timeline. With this said, what I like most is the ease of onboarding and no one has had any trouble getting up and going on Workplace. It is like Facebook, easy and something most if not all will have familiarity in navigation.","It would be helpful if a review confirmation checkbox was able to be placed by files that needed to be read or reviewed. Along the same line, approve, review again, etc. would be helpful checkboxes to add by files, proposals.
The layout is clean but suffers a bit from the center column width with two sidebars and a lot of empty space. It almost looks like a going out of business sale retail store where you notice the empty shelves. Workplace feels a bit bare at times. I think some good design modifications can help. Now on mobile, it is a great layout. I am addressing specifically the desktop browser login.
An admin control dashboard would be really effective and even more so with more users on the platform.",Keep going!

You'll definitely meet some great people amongst your peers (lovely, smart people), but you'll almost certainly meet some awful managers too (at best, ineffectual & negative; at worst, toxic). The managers I experienced talked to the team disrespectfully, as if we were children, on a regular basis and always in a negative way, never encouraging. New people to the team were always shocked initially. The 'heightened candidate experience' that they insist on for hiring, is out the door once you're actually on board and I found it a cut-throat, toxic environment, where everyone is watching their back. 
They are very heavy on KPIs to an agency-level.
The scope of the job is also very narrow due to the size of the org, so you very quickly find yourself bored and although I undoubtedly was learning some new skills, I was losing some I valued that I had acquired in previous roles.
They don't live out the values they profess, or that are reflected in the benefits package, so you might find yourself unsupported through difficult, personal times and wondering if all the great benefits are worth feeling so demeaned. They're not.",Be more positive and respectful to your reports.

5. They rely on their ability as the world's largest social media site to get get talented people but do nothing to develop them or encourage honest and fair performance reviews.

* Recruiting tools are literally the best in the business.","* The pressure to perform is insane; hitting my target + delivering on projects was just barely enough to get a meets all during the perf cycle
* Roles are becoming increasingly small and marginalised as the team continues to scale. As a result, you see people jumping (literally) on to projects to set themselves apart from the rest of the team. It makes for a bit of a cut-throat culture just around the time when PSC hits
 * If you're interviewing at facebook, prepare for a ride with R4R - they'll probably won't speak to you again after you've signed the contract
* While there are exceptions, the culture in the recruiting team is just weird. It sort of reminds me of high school. There's cliques, people gossip and there's for sure a couple of bullies: either people wouldn't even say a word to you or would go out of their way to make you feel like you're weird or different (to be honest, that also included my manager).
* Ads Credits & being forced to dog-food beta apps: I'm a huge instagram fan and big user - so being forced to update my apps multiple times a day was a nightmare.

1. Work - probably the most meaningful and impactful work you can do in your life IMO. It's incredibly challenging, and going to work feels like a mission.
You do things differently at FB, and you get to learn and explore many areas of true R&D, to eventually become a better engineer.

2. People - Kind, incredibly smart, helpful, trustworthy and fun!
I've been at FB for about 6 months now, but I never saw/experienced such a company DNA before with respect, gratitude, kindness and awareness to bias.
People here are remarkable. 

3. Benefits - fantastic! 
I don't know other places who offer such benefits in such scale.

Very big and cool issues to work on, which you wouldn't fine any where else in the world due to the sheer scale of the company.","The internal career system seems well intended and fair at first, until you try to follow it.
Very poor work-life balance. I've never worked so much in my entire career, yet it never seems enough to satisfy the criteria to grow up internally.

All internal systems are custom made and many times they compare poorly to open-source alternatives, specially from usability and stability perspective. Which means you will spend a long time to master the internal tooling and all that hard-earned knowledge will be worthless when you leave the company.
Also, that all engineers have so much freedom means that everyone is constantly reinventing the wheel, and increasing the overall complexity of the environment thus changes harder and harder as time goes by.
This is exacerbated by the bonus system, which for many years has encouraged engineers to build and deliver new things rather than fixing existing issues.

All of this combined has lead to a monstrous internal ecosystem which is a huge pile of entangled hair, where the simplest of tasks requires careful planning and understanding and will take several days.

Management has lately changed the incentives to encourage fixing and better quality, but it's too little too late.","You need to take work-life balance more seriously.
More work needs to be done on internal systems. The combination of these two can easily lead to burnouts."

* Blame showers during incident reviews (and incident triaging).
* Over the fence handovers. Fake promises by recruiters, lack of leadership.
* Walls between orgs for transfers and artificial, per-org devopment limitations. It's better to leave and reinterview with a chance of getting better offer than trying to move internally (and still going through the interviews) and getting your level frozen for a year.

There's some efforts to improve engineering practices, but get smudged and diluted by the lack of will and understanding from the leadership, and the lack of reward from the global org (doing two really crappy things gives you more performance review points than doing something with high quality, and/or refactoring any amount of the crappy things around).","Rethink the way you work, hiring smart people is not enough to build awesome things, and burning engineers is no way to maintain a company, if you want people happy..."

There is a lot of negative press on the outside about FB but on the inside you witness all of the good FB does. If you align to what they are doing it gives you a great feeling. 

As a recruiter here, its the hardest but probably most rewarding job I've had. The tools are great and getting better everyday and depending on the are you are working in you can do some really cool things! 

Free food 
Again depending on team, very casual about where and when for working","Some management have got to where they are from longevity within the business and not the impact they have which hinders people 

The review process is pretty rough, bottom line is if you don't get on with your manager you are not going to get very far in your career, a lot of bias in this process. 

They talk a lot about an open feedback company and how everyone is honest which is fair but when management can't take feedback or literally do not care then that is the issue 

Most managers are very disconnected from the recruiting process and try to dictate what you should do when generally you will know what is best for your clients",Let your employees shine more and trust in their opinion

For me it starts first and foremost with the mission: to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. I love this mission and while I've worked in other great companies in the past with great missions too - this by far - is the mission that relates most to me as an individual. It's powerful. It's empowering. It's enriching. It's transformative. Not just for me but for so many people we share the world with today but also tomorrow. What I love about it is I believe Facebook and its family of apps: Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, etc, and other technologies like it from other companies are transforming the medium of language, the medium of communication. I can remember being a young boy in the early 80's in a small city called Waterford, in the south of Ireland, being excited when introduced to the humble CD for the first time. I remember clearly the first mobile brick hand-phones, mpeg players, ipods, on and on and on. With the advent of AR/VR and the proliferation global messaging apps that connect huge parts of the world today I'm feeling a similar excitement here seeing first hand the impact these technologes are having for billions of people on the planet. I'm really enjoying being in a company not just playing a huge part in this evolutionary transformation but doing so in a company from what I can see so far is doing so with real respect for its employees. The work environment is safe, collaborative and fair. There are large degrees of flexibility, autonomy and transparency. Folks are humble and authentic, at least the ones I've all met so far, and they deeply care about their work and those people around them. I'm only new, so I'll need more to understand the company as the weeks, months and years go by, but so far so good and I'm delighted to be joining at such an early stage of its growth.",None yet.

- The FB experience varies widely between teams. I have friends who love their job and role on the team they are in. This wasn't the case for me. Your company is as good as your manager and I had no good ones.","1. Work/Life Balance
If you don't make this boundary clear yourself and actively work on creating it - it will be exploited. Communication is broken in the company so you'll get messenger pings, quip notifications, emails, google doc updates at all hours. They even do long term project planning over chat groups in some teams.

2. Loads of unnecessary stress/anxiety related issues suffered by employees due to: 
(i) Managers fawning over each other showing ""impact"" of their teams - god help you if you don't make them look good or disagree with them. Anonymous reviews come through some of the time and people can say what they want about you.
(ii) Unnecessary fighting between individual contributors due to performance review system. People ""strong arm"" you into doing work when it makes no business sense so it can make them look good.
(iii) Bad reviews stick with you and you'll be treated differently - people are managed out/disappear/don't pass probation all the time. Speaking with friends in other companies FB isn't that attractive anymore and it's reputation is changing in the jobs marketplace.
(iv) Performance reviews for the most part are opinion based (see 3 below) and not work based
(v) Bullying/Level-ism. I've seen so much of it go on here and nothing done.
(vi) Decisions a lot of the time are made from MPK and a lot of the time opinion based and not fact based which is scary. The 'Holier Than Though' engineering 'Move Fast' culture creates loads of chaos and is unnecessary.

3. You are goaled a lot on ""collaboration"" i.e. how much you are liked rather than the work you do or numbers you drive. This is a cult like characteristic where you have to be ""happy"" and ""always on."" I joined FB to work on projects to drive numbers but all my feedback was about how I got on with other people. Collaboration is important for most companies but it's fake at Facebook due to performance review system.

4. There are no formal processes for a lot of things in the company. The only analogy I have for Facebook is that it's like a big building, you go inside, peel back the wallpaper and all you will see is the pipes - the walls are missing. It's ""XFN this"" and ""XFN that"" so you reach out to teams to get things done and rely on ""collaboration"" rather than formal processes/business requirements. It's a huge surprise to me how it has gotten this far. I've seen parts of the operation down/backlogged for weeks on end due to bad planning but you can't complain about it because you won't be ""liked.""

5. GMS Summit - This event is a mix between Jonestown and being in North Korea. People stand up and applaud Zuckerberg when he comes on stage and don't sit down until he sits down. A VP (one in particular) gets on stage and tells the audience how lucky and special they are to have a job there and how grateful we should all be. Another one at the EMEA one told us to start sharing positive news about FB on our personal feeds.",

Meta,5.0,1,less than 1 year,Open and FAST moving!,2017-06-11,Community Operations,"Dublin, Dublin",2,2,2,"- The openness across the whole org. is outstanding (at least currently, you can ask anyone anything and receive an answer with the Directors openly announcing sensitive information regularly and the CEO holding weekly Q&As sessions where no question is off limits!).
- Fast moving; you are encouraged to make things happen as long as the data backs you up. For me this was an absolute shock (having a 30 min fast paced meeting which resulted in almost immediate high impacting changes)
- Passion; you are encouraged to focus on your strengths and work on the issues that you find most rewarding!
- The people; I've never worked with so many motivated, passionate and intelligent people - it really brings the best out of you. Further, you are encouraged to be your 'authentic self' which often means direction to have a better work-life balance!
- Of course... the perks are AMAZING - great pay, yummy food (yet the ""facebook 13"" is oh too real!'and the best healthcare among many well thought out perks.","- Despite the amazing perks for new parents (lots of leave!), childcare support is minimal if anything.
- Encouraging everyone to be their 'authentic selves' sometimes can cause issues (ie. some people - very few though - are authentic knob heads).
- Moving sometimes too fast to enable a reliable and trusting service; although its really encouraging to see this is being worked on from top down!
- The perks are AMAZING yet, as is probably human nature, its always tempting to look over to Google's better perks (yet they don't have our outstanding open culture which is perhaps more valuable)",Keep it up and do everything you can to maintain the open culture - this is the unique selling point to keep the right talent on board!

Its not often that you can say that you work on a product that you genuinely believe in in a company with great values and with the best caliber people. Facebook is such a place. Nobody at Facebook is there accidentally. The interview process is intentionally tough because Facebook would rather have more False Negatives than False Positives (ie they would rather be wrong they give someone a No Hire than be wrong when go ahead a hire someone). What this means is that you are working with some of the best people in the world. Also the values that the company believes in truly important. Its great to work for a place that is so open with its Employees. Since Facebook's product is all about Social, the company makes sure that employees feel free to express their opinions. Everyone is encouraged to weigh in on important decisions. The company structure is such that we dont get fancy titles and therefore we end up being more equal. Move fast is also important, and the company removes all obstacles from employees so that they can do their job well. Overall I love working at Facebook and would recommend it to everyone.","Since the company is focused on impact, work life balance could be better. People often feel that putting in an extra hour or two a day will increase their impact. Usually this is correct, but will cause the employee to burn out faster which the company doesnt want.",

The revenue performance of the company says it all, they are rich and generous with employees. You're really spoiled here.

Unique opportunities with an ability to learn on a daily basis, really building up your resume with an ability to fill any gap with new experiences. People are quite protective of their work and don't like others stepping on their toes, as normal, but there is so much to do that you can create your own role and work on the matters that are of highest interest to you.","No decision making. This sounds incredible, but it's true. Decisions are taken as part of cross-functional meetings where everyone has an opinion and nobody is really driving. Somehow, it seems to work well because decisions ARE taken! But the downside is that it creates a lot of insecurity as people are really freaked out that things blow up (and it blows up quickly here, considering the regular negative media headlines) and that they be blamed. Managers in particular, are very sensitive, insecure and as a result, they tend to micro-manage or get involved in matters they shouldn't be involved with at their level. A lot of dissatisfaction about management all around. 

A lot of pressure to get the job done. You need to be resilient and work hard on preserving your work/life balance.

Company culture is poor - extremely political and everyone is focused on building their career. We all know that having Facebook on our resume will open fantastic doors! It's ok to navigate the politics and survive though..you just need to be aware of it and of the fact that your colleagues will not hesitate to throw you under the bus if they feel threatened!",(to low-level management:) Breath and stop thinking that the entire company lays on your shoulders :-) we will all survive even if you take 2 weeks PTO!

Having this level of impact and being part of a relatively tiny team means you can really feel the value of the work you do.

It gives you the opportunity to constantly excel. 
- Another benefit of working here is the fact that almost most of the colleagues are high achievers, thus always inspiring to do more and to do it better.

- Salary is very competitive, benefits are very fair.
- Moreover, the working environment is full of respect, and even in case there was a disagreement it would never amount to more than that, usually solvable and manager is ready to step in and find a solution, all done in a very smooth and civil way.

Meta,5.0,1,less than 1 year,Such a great place to work,2017-09-11,Engineering Manager,"London, England",2,2,2,"The culture here is fantastic; there are so many things that just work well together. For example, most engineers choose which team to join after the first 6 weeks or so, which encourages a lot of really positive behaviours. The company is also really open, allowing everyone to make great decisions: if you need access to some data, you probably have it available. 

We have good tools and infrastructure that allows us to focus on the important things; things like booking a meeting room, following up on a task in a common system and many other things are just easy, using great tools that an internal team builds and maintains. I also think that the engineering-led approach to product development and a willingness to try things is really special, and allows us to be more bold than most other companies.

Oh, and the free food! Breakfast, lunch and dinner, with lots of great options, both healthy and not-so-healthy.","It's not a great place if you value being in charge, or being told specifically what to do when. Everyone is expected to be self-led to a large extent.

Meta,5.0,1,more than 1 year,Client Partner - Financial Services Better than I could have possibly imagined.,2018-09-18,Client Partner,"Toronto, ON",2,2,2,"Instead of completing a formal review, I’ll share a post I made to celebrate my 1 year anniversary since joining Facebook.
—-

Today marks my first year at Facebook. We call it a Faceversary. And, while celebrating your work 
anniversary might seem a bit frivolous (or at least I thought so early on), I quickly learned to appreciate the FB tradition that’s built around these Faceversaries. It’s valuable to reflect on all that happens in a year at work, considering how much energy, time, and effort we put into it. 

When you make it to your 10-year milestone (my count down starts now), you get the opportunity to join Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, and others on the management team to tell a 10-year Faceversary story to the entire company. Those are always funny or emotional, or both. 
 
So, what can I share after my first year here? 
 
TL;DR: Work with and learn from the very best people. Drinking from the firehose and learning a ton. Autonomy, authority and support. World-class benefits. Open culture to the bones. An inside look at how serious everyone is about minimizing the bad and building more of the good. Five core values in action. Pretty darn happy. 
 
I get the pleasure to work with incredible, impressive, and talented people daily. Both within the walls of Facebook, but also with clients and partners who are working on some unbelievable things. My pod and my core team are just legendary. This isn’t lip service. I really get to work with and learn from the very best. 
 
I’ve learnt SO MUCH. About digital advertising and marketing. About financial services. About media. About other industry verticals I previously knew nothing about. About navigating complex circumstances. About working for a company that’s constantly in the spotlight. About digging deeper to really understand. About cross-functional collaboration. About partnerships. About technology. And much more. Internally, they say every day at Facebook is equivalent to a week. I now know why. 
 
I have the autonomy, authority, and support I need to be successful and run my marketing consulting business the way I see fit. Further, I get to shape and influence how businesses engage, nurture, and build new relationships with people.

I have access to incredible benefits that I’m astonished by daily and so grateful for. In fact, I’m writing this post while on paid paternity leave to spend time with my family and our new addition, Logan. 
 
Facebook fosters an open culture that is like nothing I’ve ever seen before. Mark hosts a weekly company-wide Q&A where he addresses thoughtful and difficult questions about a wide-range of issues and opportunities. Everyone, from Interns to tenured employees, are welcome to ask anything and they don’t face judgement or criticism for raising difficult topics. On our internal Workplace (Facebook for Work), I can join and learn about a whole host of interesting projects, regardless of whether I’m involved in them. 
 
I’ve learnt a lot about both the harmful ways and the incredibly positive ways Facebook can be used. I get a firsthand look at how serious everyone is about minimizing the bad and building more of the good.

There are 5 core values that guide how we work at Facebook. And I see them in practice regularly. Build social value. Move fast. Be bold. Be open. Focus on impact. 
 
I’ve always been fortunate in my career. I’ve worked on amazing teams, on fascinating projects, with inspiring mentors and leaders. Facebook has been a continuation of that for me. But, I must say, I’ve never been this happy. 
 
So, here’s to one amazing year and the many more to follow!",The bar has been set so high for any future employer to be within my consideration set. I’m truly spoiled.,

My manager kept pushing me to work more and more (I worked weekends, late at night). The catch is they say you don't have hours and you administrate your time, but the workload is so heavy you need to work extra hours regularly and sacrifice work-life balance.

Some managers have very bad people skills and the company doesn't really pay attention.

I appreciate it especially when I compare myself to my peers in other companies. We get paid very competitively and the perks are amazing. The job itself is rather interesting as well. I love the very caring and chilled atmosphere in the office - coming from consulting, no overtime and no extreme pressure is really a big difference. Most of the people in the office are quite smart and really fun to work with. I also love how international the Dublin office is, before joining I didn't see it as something very important but now I understand why everyone from FB keeps mentioning that.","- The constant talk about growth. Facebook is not growing as fast as it used to, yet the company hires like crazy. To be honest I think this is too much at this point. All these people are doing ""projects"" but these projects are in 3/4 not useful at all. The sole purpose of them is that someone can write it in their performance review but no one really uses the outcome of the project after that. 
- Despite the management saying how international the company is, every decision is still taken by Americans/British/Irish and according to their worldview. Which sometimes has awful effects on the company image in countries that were not part of the Commonwealth or are the US. It's particularly visible when there is a PR fire in American or British media, they can change something overnight based on that not thinking about how it will impact other parts of the world. Also it's worth mentioning that a huge majority of managers is Irish/British, and there is little internal mobility for non-natives. 
- Performance review is somehow not fair. Technically there are career expectations but if you fulfil all of them, you'll get the lowest score. There are people from certain parts of the world that would be working 16h a day (I'm thinking East Asia in particular) to get the best score so then people from other parts of the world need to work longer as well, otherwise their achievements will look pale compared to those working overtime. And performance assessment, potential promotion and bonus, are based on your place on the curve rather than on whether you fulfilled criteria of your job. 
- Internal mobility rules are very unfair. As an external applicant you'd meet and even exceed all the criteria for a particular role but if you are internal you cannot move to a role that is higher grade than yours. This leads to a situations in which people who applied internally were rejected, left the company and were soon approached by recruiters for the very role on LinkedIn if they'd be interested.","Committing so much to Dublin was not a good idea. Ads revenue is increasingly being taxed in other countries anyway. The other reason - ""access to great talent"" - is somehow flawed given that most of people are sourced outside of Ireland anyway. And given how unattractive and expensive Dublin is, some departments are getting over 50% decline rate from candidates because good professionals know housing in Dublin is a big problem (both to get it and the quality of it)."

The working environment is collaborative, open and focused on impact. 

People. Some of the smartest people I have ever had a chance to deal with. Hard-working, fun, collaborative, creative and driven. They are not all made from the same mold and diversity is important. In Dublin, I love the multicultural environment, it is respectful of everyone's culture and creates a great vibe around the office. 

Perks. Alright so the initial salary is not the highest compared to other companies I have worked for. However, the 6 monthly bonuses (performance based), stock, salary adjustment every year, free healthy delicious food all day really add up. I have had higher base salaries in previous jobs, but going to work every day without fearing what the day brings, and lower stress-levels are just priceless. Also put in the Irish/Dublin context (very very grim unemployment figures), it is a solid job with career prospects. 

What we do. Putting aside the people, the cool office and many perks, I really love what I do.

Performance evaluation random and highly driven by Management's perception of the person rather than basing it Impact on the job.

Office spaces are nice, the benefits are really good, plus they continuously update their 'Life@' perks which can be handy and convenient.","The worst part about Facebook is the culture. With the excuse that you should 'focus on impact', people will fight for 'sexy' projects and things that will obtain them a good performance review. Since middle and upper management often do not have a clue about what their own teams actually do, whatever you can make sound important (e.g. with fake metrics or tales of potential impact), you are onto a winner. Unfortunately, the same managers do not enforce a culture of fairness or trust; instead, it is a culture of rewarding back-stabbers and people who 'get the work done' but who, at the same time, treat their colleagues poorly. By that, I mean stealing projects or not giving credit to those who get the work done, for example. It is an awful environment to work in. Some teams are worse than others as well: You could end up reporting into a bad apple who steals projects from you. It happens, and it happens often.

Good people managers are never rewarded, as people management is not something Facebook recognises as important. Yes, in the orientation they will give you a big speech about it but when was the last time good people managers got promotions? Managers should focus on people, and ICs should focus on things. Unfortunately, bad managers who are good at IC work get rewarded often to the detriment of their teams, who have to suffer under people who should have never become people managers. The so-called Pulse survey is a joke, as no importance is given to low-scoring managers. If 10 people in a team say they would not work with their manager again, something must be wrong, don't you think? 

To any potential employees: Do not get fooled by the appearances. Facebook makes people feel trapped because they make you think this is the 'best' company and that you should be grateful you are part of Mark Zuckerberg's dream of making the world more 'open and connected'. It's a fallacy. Do not fall for it.","Upper management need to pay more attention to the people under them, and make their managers accountable. It is too easy to hide bad things at Facebook, simply because Directors and VPs are too busy trying to make their pyramid schemes even larger. 

HR need to be more people-focused, as they don't support non-managers, even when you have genuine issues. They will always protect and engage with managers, so if you have issues, well... you are better off not asking your HRBP, as they will simply say they are too busy for your minuscule needs."

- The feedback cycles are too political. This is one of the worst things about Facebook. It has 'imported' bad habits and bad people from other companies who brought their corporate baggage with them. It didn't used to be like this. 
- People work on projects based on their six-month feedback review, not what's good for a team or the company. The lack of accountability from upper management makes this much worse. People get promoted for 'inventing' things that get abandoned after a month. 
- If you are good at public relations but do nothing, you can get very far at Facebook. It means you have 'visibility'. It's poisonous. 
- It has become so cynical that the latest 'trick' to get someone promoted to director is for them to organise a 'global' gathering. In other words, bring a bunch of people to Menlo Park, say it's for team building and give it a funky name or a motto... and boom! They become a Very Senior Person.
- Zero work/life balance. You must be available 24/7.","ACCOUNTABILITY! There is a huge gap between directors and VPs and the rest of the company.

Value: Done is better than perfect - the incorrect interpretation is that done and perfect are mutually exclusive, no-one wants to do anything that is perfect.
Value: We [managers / leaders] are non-directive - incorrect interpretation is that managers do not need to provide direction, the result is that manager are ineffective and simply try to please employees.
Value: Make an impact - incorrect interpretation is any impact is a good impact, the actual impact of this is that there is little significant impact.

The company has many conflicting ways of working, for example the short term review process and the want and need to take risks and innovate. The result is that employees do not want to take long term risks as they will be penalised in their next review.

There is a PIP (personal improvement plan) process to help those underachieving to get back on track. This is only effective at removing people from the company and during new manager training (FME) managers are informed that most people (>80%) that are placed on a PIP leave the company. At the same time the company prides itself on the ability of employees to have tough conversations (Crucial Conversations is a class employees are encouraged to attend) yet no-one has these tough conversations. There is a reliance on processes such as the PIP process to remove people from the company rather than having direct conversations.","Start again with managers.

But don’t get it twisted! All the free food, snacks, drinks etc. are made to keep you at work longer :)","Looking back at my experience there, I can clearly see that I was unfortunate to end up in a team that I was in. The fact that no one internally wanted to move to that team should have alarmed me, but having just moved to FB I didn’t think of leaving that early. Internally, people were very open about how they would rather quit than join our team. I figured that’s the reason why they hired a complete new team, instead of just moving some people around. 
 
However, people at FB are generally blinded by the perks and the status of the company. They make themselves believe that they are happy, but in reality everyone is constantly anxious. They just learn to cope and make it feel normal. 

The pressure is HIGH and the workload tremendous. Because of the amount of silly meetings that you can’t say no to, you will end up spending more than 50 hours per week to make sure you are up to speed. Some people at FB told me that work consumed every second of their life (they just couldn’t switch off). I knew of other colleages that they come in on a Saturday to do some extra work, and some dedicate their Sunday evening on projects to add to their internal CV. 
You can’t really switch off, at least not before 9PM. So, if you’re in a relationship/have kids, don’t go there. As a single person I felt bad for my colleagues with a family.

In my situation, and I also speak for the rest of the team, there was no support, no proper internal onboarding and literally no one around to be able to inform you what the general expectations were. It’s all very performance driven, so you have to Build up that amount of work you do, cause everything gets tracked. They don’t care how you do it, just do it. This explains why people work throughout the weekend to make sure they hit a certain amount of finished tasks for that week before the new week starts. You will be compared to Peers on your level, so it’s important to make sure you hit at least average to receive some bonus after your review. 

We had a new manager starting a few months after us, and hierarchy was the management style. Having anything to say went against the manager’s principles and clearly we weren’t liked. So were other colleagues of other teams not liked by this manager, because of their opinions. Be mindful of what you say...not everything is appreciated. 
At FB, managers are more valued than IC’s and they rather keep a bad manager than a good IC. So please be careful and try to make your manager your friend, trust me it will help you. 

They have amazing trainings on how to manage bias, but in all honesty, everyone was biased. The way they hired people, they way they treated people and the way they rated each other. During the annual performance cycle, you would only ask feedback from the people you had a good relationship with to help you get your bonus. 

Up until now, FB was the least favorable experience for me. I only say ‘worst experience’ when I talk to friends. They saw the negative impact it had on me working in a toxic environment. 

I do want to say that 2% genuinely loves working there, unfortunately the majority doesn’t.","Be fair, honest and be better managers. Look at your team and listen to them. Maybe changing teams could help them enjoy the company more."
